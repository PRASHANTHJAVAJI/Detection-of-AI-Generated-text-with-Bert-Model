One of the primary benefits of car-free cities lies in their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities efficiently utilize urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a substantial financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for individuals and the community as a whole. The passage set provides evidence of this trend happening in different parts of the world, including Germany, France, and Colombia. In these places, efforts have been made to reduce the dependence on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage can lead to a cleaner environment, healthier individuals, and better community planning.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution being released into the environment. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where air pollution can have severe health consequences for residents.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on individual health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, mentions that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on that particular day. Engaging in physical activity like walking or cycling instead of driving can help improve cardiovascular health and overall fitness. It can also reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to better community planning and more efficient land use.

It also helps create more vibrant and walkable communities, where people can easily access amenities without relying on cars.

It is important to note that limiting car usage does not mean completely eliminating cars. In Vauban, car ownership is allowed, but parking is limited, with only two places to park in large garages at the edge of the development. This allows residents to still have access to cars when needed, but encourages them to use alternative modes of transportation for their daily needs. This approach strikes a balance between convenience and sustainability.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact our lives and the environment. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote a healthier lifestyle, create more efficient and sustainable urban planning, and foster a sense of community. By adopting this approach, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for individuals and communities. One of the main benefits is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. In Europe, for example, passenger cars account for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas of the United States, the number can go up to 50%. By limiting car usage, we can make a significant impact in reducing these emissions and mitigating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In cities like Paris and Bogota, where strict driving bans have been implemented during periods of heavy smog, significant reductions in pollution and congestion have been observed. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease air pollution and create healthier environments for everyone.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on public health. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or taking public transit, can lead to increased physical activity. Regular physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. By creating car-free communities and promoting active transportation, we can improve the overall health and well-being of individuals.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and livable communities. In car-free communities like Vauban in Germany, residents have reported increased happiness and reduced stress levels. Without cars, streets become safer and more enjoyable for pedestrians and cyclists. Additionally, having stores and amenities within walking distance reduces the need for long car trips, making communities more compact and accessible.

Finally, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. When fewer people drive, there is less need for extensive road infrastructure and parking spaces. This can free up valuable land for other purposes, such as housing or green spaces.

"The Electoral College should be abolished. It is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"". It just makes so much more sense to go with the popular vote from everyone. Even Bob Dole agreed to this and said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" Most people just despise it anyways, let's just get rid of it already.

Let's face it, if you have a vote, it would go to the slate of electors who in turn, vote for the president. The worst thing about it is that sometimes they can't even control their own vote. What use is that? It doesn't make sense if they can't even control something that they have such as a vote. Also some voters get confused and don't know what to vote for though. Instead, they can vote for the wrong candidate. This is why we should get rid of the Electoral College. It's just so unfair to other voters that they can't have their way because the others get confused. This can let to political disasters and events that will make people riot over a mistake that they made. They need to learn that the Electoral College needs to go.

First off, the founding fathers established the Electoral College in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It was was founded all the way back then, it must surely be outdated and we should really try to go by our modern intelligent ways now. They believed the ""winner takes all"" system that just doesn't make sense anymore if you can just vote on your own and when the President wins, it will just be the popular vote from overall everyone.

Secondly, the people in Congress are well educated indeed, but do we really need their separate votes? Can we just skip that? We are already getting the ""popular vote of qualified citizens"" which is good. All these electors are just so unnecessary when it comes down to it. I understand only a few people still want the electoral College in place, but in all honesty, it is only what they have been taught and they think it is the right thing. There are ""538"" electors in the Electoral College and they need a majority of ""270"" electoral votes. This seems far too complicated just for voting on a President. All we need is the popular vote. There has even been a case in the 2000's that is called ""Disaster Factor"". Americans are even lucky that this event isn't the most that can potentially happen with the Electoral College in place. We should avoid this political disaster at all costs!

In the end, we should all finally understand that the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational. It was made long, long ago and we have a better way to vote other than dealing with the mess of electors getting confused and the people in Congress dealing with it all together. Just go by the popular vote from the people and we would be good to go.",0
"Limiting car usage would be an extraordinary improvement in everyone's daily lives. When you think of Bejing, China what do you see? Busy streets filled with cars, sky scrapers, and SMOG. The earth shouldn't be treated like this, when people excessively drive it creates significant amounts of greenhouse gases. Also, we shouldn't have to live in this kind of environment, filled with smog, it's very unhealthy to inhale these substances. Think about a world with no cars for a second like in Vauban, Germany walking to work which gets in a quick morning exercise, watching kids play with their friends outside, clear skies, oh and actually being able to take a deep breath without suffocating. These are all marvelous reasons to reduce car usage.

Think of Earth before cars there were clear skies, green views, blue seas, birds chirping in the morning. Nice right? Well, now come back to reality where the air is gray, the fields are covered with roads or dirt, the seas are filled with oil and the sea animals all fighting for their lives. According to experts, ""passengers are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in United States"". Is sitting in a car, being lazy, stuck in a traffic jam really worth this? You could be out enjoying the view taking it all in, getting in a few minutes of exercise even. To me, there is no question, I won't be responsible for the lives of others.

Now, jump forward a few years, imagine excessive car use, black skies, no room to walk. Who wants this kind of environment to live in? Noone, and thats why we need to change our lifestyles a tad, otherwise this is what it will be like. The smog that cars create is not good for you, it damages your lungs slowly, but surely. My question is would you rather save a few minutes getting to work and die a few years early, or walk to work, enjoying the beautiful view of nature and also getting some exercise in? I think this decision is the easiest one a person could make.

Lastly, think about the future generations, do you want them to be unhealthy and relying on automobiles their whole lives or do you want them to experience the awesome adventures life has? Don't use your car for one day, that's not too much to ask and just appreciate your neighbors, the animals and all the amazing things Earth has to offer. That will surely change your mind about using cars and if it doesn't have a nice life struggling to take a breath and see more than a few feet in front of you.

I definitely think that car usage has a major negative impact on our environment and it needs to change. Cars hurt our Earth, our health, and our daily lives distorting us from what we really need. Apparently, ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.."" this is an amazing start and I hope it continues.",0
"Electoral Colleges is something many people disagree with but there is a few that are for the idea. Personally i think we should get rid of the Electoral colleges for many reasons. First, when using the electoral college you do not vote for the president but you vote for a slate of electors, I think when you are voting you should have a choice for which president you vote for not electors. Using this, the electors have to win which I dont think is right.

Using electoral votes effects the people in smaller states. Big states have more of a ""voice"" to who wins the election if enough people vote. People living in smaller states have less of a chance of there choosen president to win because they dont have a large number of electoral votes. Saying that people in the smaller states know that they dont have much of a say to votes and are going to stop voting in general and stop paying attention to the campaigns.

The winnertakeall method is something that voters dont like. Candidates know that some states dont have a lot of electoral votes so they dont bother to reach out to them and dont spend time on them because they think or know they dont have a chance of winning their election. Since candidates dont go to small states that means they spend all their time in the bigger states trying to win them over and get their votes. People dont think its fair that the candidates dont make any effort to pay attention to them.

When you vote for who you want as president you dont actually vote for the president you vote mostly for a slate of electors. from the excerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" stated it is the electors that vote for presidents not us. i think that we should have more of a choice for who we want as our president but we do not. We should get rid of the Electoral College because it doesnt help us as i can see many people do not like it.",0
"Limiting car usage is not bad at all! It benefits everyone in a specific way.

As stated in the article carFree cities Source 1: Heidrum Walter, a media trainer and mother two quotes ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much more happier this way"" Heidrum being a mother two you can only imagine the car trips she would have to make. Going place to place can cause a lot of stress to some people and it makes it harder for them to drive. For example, someone could be stressed to the max with all the traffic and driving around that it could create accidents along the way. No one should ever feel stressed while driving. Driving should be a privilege and good one.

In Paris they have banned driving due to smog. Diesel fuel was blamed since France has tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris has more smog than other European capitals. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Certain things like this can help save the environment without the usage of vehicles.

With no car usage it prevents teens from getting into accidents and or drunk driving. The safer way to go is to walk or stay with a friend somewhere safe than being on the road. Many accidents could be prevented but it wont if limiting the car usage is not available. Death rates will decrease and many people will be safer this way. A study last year found that drving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Without transportation many young people could make other main priorities. For example, they could organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.

Up above I have given my reasons why we should all limit car usage. It would relieve stress from on the road, saves the environment and takes the smog away, and young people would be more socialize and up for doing more than what they already do like jobs.",0
"Dear State Senator, The one word used throughout this whole article catastrophic, which is whats best used to describe the electoral college. The United States of America, born and based off of popular sovereignty, should be just that decided by the people. The electoral college has only been a hindrance since its arrival, confusing American Citizens left and right, becoming an issue to votersinterested future voters, and disallowing a fair chance of a voters vote to be of importance in their state, and to their country. The electoral college should be disbanded and reiterated by popular vote because of TWO main reasons:it does allow for a simple method of voting, and it does allow for every vote, and voice to be heard in the United States presidency election, tarnishing this country's right of democracy, causing outrages all over the country.

To initialize this onesided argument, lets begin with an important factor that the electoral college cannot be trusted on achieving, the fact that every vote counts. With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register ""Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.

Theories on how a single vote doesn't matter have been given, as stated in Par. 23 Source 3 by Richard A. posner ""Voters in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."", who also comes to contradict themselves originally with ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% Percent plurality"". In that instance, that one vote could've made a HUGE difference on our future. On top of that, so many voices in states that arent swing states States that could go democratic or republican, and aren't fixated on only 1 party that have been silenced could add up to be a tremendous amount of 'single votes', changing this nations history drastically.

Furthermore onto this argument one thing is known as a world wide factor that applies to almost everything that we do. Simpler, is better. If you take your precious time and read all Par. 18 in Source 1, what you will gather, is that an extremely overafflictionated method is used when determining our next president. Step by step instructions on selecting, choosing, voting, controling, and nevermind the problems it has already caused from the confusion of all these instructions. Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote. This would furthermore simplify our country way of voting, attracting more voters, and overall satisfying many people.

Some have also stated that this is necessary to providing a more organized form of voting. Key knowledge that must be analyzed is that: just because a service is organized, does NOT mean its correct. Referencing to Par. 11 Source 2 Bradford Plumer describes on how ""The American People should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century the system allows for much worse."" and ""that those elctors could always defy the will of the people."" in Par. 9 ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after AlGoreThanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Many problems that would not ocurr if our way of voting were to be simplified into popular vote.

To summarize, and simplify what should be done with our voting ways this letter to you, we should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting, to which our country is based off of. This is the most profound way of fixing the problems that we face: the unsimplicity known as our current voting ways, and the restablishment of our original, and hopefully still true government of Democracy, and Popular Soveriegnty.",0
"Presidential elections are a big part of the American culture. They decide who will be president for the next 4 years, who will be the one making all the choices. But is our way of chosing that person right? We use electoral colleges to decide for president. Some people believe that we shouldn't have electoral colleges, and that we should let the peoples vote be the one to decide. But electoral colleges are a good way of deciding our future president for many reasons, it allows for a certainty of outcome, avoid runoff elections, and balance out the distribution of votes.

Electoral colleges will allow for a certainty of an outcome. The amount of electoral college votes are 538 this allows for us to see a clear difference in the votes for each party, as oppose to a people votes where you have hundreds of millions of people voting making it impossible to see a clear difference unless you have a blow out. The outcome of a tie is possible but according to the third source ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538is an even number, but it is highly unlikely..."" Also most states use a winnertakeall system where the majority of the votes in a state would win the electoral votes of that state providing a voice for the people. This this shows that having electoral votes decide the president is a good idea because it marks a clear winner.

Having electoral college votes will also allow us to avoid runoff elections. Runoff elections are when no part receives a majority of the votes. Electoral colleges help avoid that because of the fact that they are distributed evenly and mark a clear winner. ""Runoff elections add a huge amount of burden on the candidates, but some of the pressure is reduced by the electoral colleges"" states the third source.

The distribution of votes is balanced out evenly thanks to electoral colleges. If a state is larger then they will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. For example the third passage states that ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" This shows how the state that is larger in population gets more votes pleasing more people.

The electoral college is a great way to determine the future president for many reasons. Some being that it allows for a clearer outcome, avoids runoff elections, and distributes the votes evenly among the states population.",0
"Dear State Senator, I am here to inform you that you should change election to a popular vote for the president of the United States. This is due to the fact that as of now Americans vote to elect their president, but what good is that if they don't even receive what they want? What is even the point of voting? Saying this, I agree with source two on its point, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This is backed up with data from the same article stating that voters can't even control whom their electors vote for. This is clearly why ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Without a doubt if you cared for your people, the people who support you and give you your job opportunity, you would see that you should abolish this electoral college. Even a blind man could see that.

You may be wondering if your people think this is such a bad idea, why would our founding fathers implement something so horindess? As you see ""electoral college was established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", says source 1. Although that sounded great at the time, today electoral college is frowned upon because majorly because of its ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. As if that wasn't unfair enough, the electors don't even necessarily have to vote for their states choice. This would be similar to if I was infatuated with a color, I then asked my team what our team color should be and after taking a vote, I chose the color I preferred because I was bias even though my whole team disliked it. This is obviously the wrong way to run our election especially the most important in our country.

On the other hand I do understand that there are some advantages to an electoral college. These include, mentioned in source 3, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaignthan a small state does. This is fair because there are more people in big states then small therefore big states should get more of a voice. Although in popular vote big states would still get the bigger vote because there are more people voting therefore they have more votes. This is why I think the middle man should just be cut out leaving us with a popular vote.

According to the facts it is clear to me that the electoral college should be siezed. I think it is unnecessary as well as unfair. When we think of voting for our president, that is what we want to do. Voting for our president does not include voting for someone who may or may not choose our choice. Also if we chose our President by popular vote all the votes that weren't majority would add up and possibly make the difference between the vote results. This is why it is unfair to simply use majority rule for each state and practically erase the other votes off the table. As you can see State Senator your people vote to elect their ruler. Why deny them of this oppurtunity. It is clear to me that the electoral college may have been a good concept to our founding father but when applyed is not the best decision. This is why I think you should change to an election by popular vote for president of the United States.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, To keep the Electoral College or to change the election by popular vote is the question many people are facing today. There are many different reason why we should keep, and same for as why we should change it. I believe we should change the election from the Electoral College to popular vote because, with the Electoral College people are voting for a slate of electors not an actual presidential candidate, it is unfair for our American people, and most people prefer the popular vote.

By voting for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors who vote for the presidential candidate. This means that our votes don't really count for much. It also means that even though we voted for someone the slate could have voted for someone completely different. Also we the people have no idea who the electors are. Who even picks them? The electors that are chosen depends on the state, sometimes it's the state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes it can be the presidential candidate himself. Some voters didnt even see campaign ads, so how did they chose their presidential caudate? They didn't, the Electoral College did.

America is suppose to be a free state, that is fair, but are we really? The Electoral College is one thing I can point out as unfair. Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system, that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate, but what if the people didn't want that candidate? Why should he get our way of speaking to the government? How are we even sure that he didn't elect himself? Also candidates don't spend time in the states they know they will have a chance of winning because of biasim. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

In reality we all want our way, or our voice and or actions to make an impact, with the Electoral College that's not happening, which is making the people of our country unhapy with the government, which means we all can't get along. Most people prefer elections to be based on popular vote so they know they get what they want, so they know they're actually making an impact.

With this being said, I believe I have made my impact on your thoughts of the question, "" to keep the Electoral College, or change election to popular vote?"". The Electoral College has both it's upsides and it's downside, but I believe it has more flaws than perfections. Yes, it has been around for many decades and is apart of our histroy, maybe it worked then, but it's not working now. And we need to make a change before things get worse.",0
"In cities such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, people are getting serious about cutting down on the vast usage of cars. The ""car free"" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of pollutants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, ""The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental protection Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By eliminating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.

With less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunities for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reporters Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant moter"", and ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.

An official from Transportation for America says, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.

With many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere.",0
"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.

The election process should be changed to one decided by popular vote instead of using the process of the Electoral College. First of all source two states that voters can sometimes get confused on the candidate that they actually voted for since they're not directly voting for the President. Another flaw of the Electoral College also stated in source two is that ""... ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...."" That is pure lying. That basically just made that voter vote for the candidate that they did not want. Another critical error is that in the process of the Electoral College is that not all states are equally represented. For example if there is a tie in the Electoral vote the election would be handed to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This wouldnt be fair because since each state casts only one vote, then the single representative from Wyoming would only represent 500,000 voters. However the single representativee from California would represent 35 million voters. That hardly seems fair.

With Popular vote every American would get their say in a democratic way. As source three states ""... the Electoral College is not democratic in a modern sense. With popular vote everyone would be represented equally.

I understand that ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" causes less chance of a dispute over the Electoral college than of the popular vote, but not everyone really gets a say. Also i understand that the Electoral College avoids run off elections but that is still very rare.

State Senator it's time to abolish the Electoral college, and switch to the use of popular vote for elections.",0
"Cars are one of the main causes of air pollution is the United States and the world. If everyone would limit their car usage, one would see all the great benefits of not using a car as much. Limiting car usage helps keep our planet clean and people would be a lot happier.

To begin with limiting car usage would help keep our plant clean. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", the author, Duffer, states ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" After this ban was enforced Paris' air was cleared in a less than a week. This proves that one doesn't even have to limit their car usage a lot, even just a little bit helps. In the article, ""The End of Car Culture"", the author, Rosenthal, claims that Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, wants to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lowers emissions and improve safety."" This shows that even Bill Ford, the chairman of FORD MOTOR COMPANY, even agrees that limiting car usage would help lower global pollution.

On another hand, limiting car usage makes people a lot happier. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", the author, Rosenthal, states ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two...."" A normal person, a person like everyone else, claims that they're happier without a car, less stressful, imagine what just limiting your car usage would do. In the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", the author, Selsky, says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as her rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" This shows that limiting car usage for just a day, takes away stress and helps the planet. Wouldn't it be nice to have a stressfree day?

In conclusion, limiting car usage, even just a little, reduces pollution and causes happiness. One can help themselves, while also helping the planet.",0
"I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. If we keep the Electoral College, then even if you do earn the most individual votes, you might not be elected president. If you have earned the most individual votes then you should be elected president because you have the majority vote. If we keep the electoral College then if you are elected president but do not receive the majority of the individual votes, the president elected by the Electoral College will not be a popular president to the people who voted against them.

Source 2 says, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" So with the Electoral College, the electors that are chosen might not elect those who they said they would. But with election by popular vote, the person elected will always be who the majority of the country wants as president.

Source 1 states, ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators."" So some states have more votes than others. If someone who is running get more states to vote for them, it does not mean that they will be elected because they have to get more votes overall from the electors.

Source 3 says, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" So with the Electoral College, even though the people vote, they are not the ones who are electing the president. Source 3 also says, When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" So whoever you are voting for, you dont know if the slate of electors will vote in that direction.",0
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.",0
"""Boys and girls of every age, wouldn't you like to see something strange?"" After hundreds of years with the Electoral College working just fine, it would be very strange for Americans to just give it up in the name of convenience. The Electoral College should stay in place because our founding fathers created it, it keeps socialism and communism out, and it is in the constitution.

Our founding fathers did many things that would ensure the United States is in safe position for centuries to come. We have the freedom of speech, religion, press, to bear arms, and of privacy. These are just as important as the Electoral College. The founding fathers of the United States wanted to make sure Americans didn't vote for communist or socialist presidents by popular vote. So they created the Electoral College, a system of voting in which each state has a certain number of points based on the amount of Senators and Congressmen representing tha state. If a presidential candidate has a majority of votes in the state, the candidate wins all the points from the state. According to the first source, there is a current total of 538 points in America and it takes 270 for a candidate to win. There is not one thing the founding fathers did that harmed the United States America should have faith in these men and not charismatic candidates who plan to go against the constitution.

Furthermore, the Electoral college keeps socialism and communism out of our capitalist democracy. Sometimes people don't fully understand politics and vote to simply make their voice count somehow. It may sound illogical, but everyone makes wrong decisions sometimes. The Electoral College is in place to keep people from falling into traps and voting for socialist candidates who plan to rid the U.S. of its freedom. According to the second source, Jimmy Carter, one of the worst presidents America has ever had, and Bob Dole, a presidential candidate who lost to Bill Clinton, were in favor of getting rid of the Electoral College. If popular vote were in place, the one with the most votes overall wins. That would make it a popularity contest and anyone who has witnessed one of those in high school knows they never end well. America has not had a socialist president with the Electoral college who is to say there will not be one without it?

Additionally, the Electoral College is written in the constitution. According to the first source, the Electoral College in the constitution and is briefly mentioned in the 23rd amendment, which allows District of Colombia to participate in the Electoral College and gives it 3 electors. Getting rid of a law, or in this case a system of voting, from the constitution is never a logical decision. For example, the 8th amendment,""no cruel and unusual punishment"", is not a wise choice to get rid of and nor is the 2nd amendment ""the right to bear arms"". Why? Because it would turn America into something it isn't it provides more government control over its citizens. Without the Electoral College, everyone's vote is seen and counted, even the independent ones and the votes of the elderly. The constitution is a guide for the people from those who fought and died for the country and it should never be altered for convinience.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should stay where it is because it was created by the founding fathers, it keeps communism and socialism out, and it is in the constitution. If the United States were to rely on anyone, it should be the founders of the country itself, for they were the ones who fought for the freedom of the country.",0
"Cars have been around for ages now, people are constantly making new models to make them better. But what were to happen if we took them away and we only relied on walking or riding bikes. There are three reasons why I believe this would be a benefit for everyone. Picture it, a world without cars.

People believe cars to be a necessity, so they will be able to get from place to place but there are advantages to limiting the usage of cars in certain areas. For one it would reduce the amount of greenhouse gas, source 1 tells about a suburban town where there are no cars. It states that only 12 percent of greenhouse gas emits in europe while in america it is up to 50 percent. While Paris bans driving because of all the smog, statistics from source 2 show that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter.

Following that, limiting the usage of cars can lower stress levels. In Bogota, Colombia they begin their day without cars for the third year straight. The citizens of Bogota were very cooperative of this. The mayor tells how even ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"". Source 3 informs how even businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza rode a two seater bicycle with his wife and how he believes ""It's a good way to reduce stress and lower air pollution."", as they continue their newly found tradition other cities in colombia such as Cali and Valledupar join in on the event. Looks like Colombias program is starting to spread for the better.

Finally, bringing it back home to America on the advantages on limiting car usage. President Obama shares his plan to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. Sources from article 4 tell how Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and how fewer are getting their license as the years go by, statistics show a large drop in the amount of 16 to 39 year olds getting their license. this article also tells how sociologists believe that if this counties it will be beneficial for the enviornment. New York being one of the most populated states has a new bikesharing program as well as carsharing programs to help contribute to lessen the pollution and emission of greenhouse gases.

In Conclusion, while cars have been and are a great asset limiting the use of them could greatly benefit every one by using lessening stress levels, lowering pollution, and reduce the amount of greenhouse gas. Looks like we're already headed in the right direction.",0
"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is unfair for voters all around the United States. The Electoral College is a Winnertakeall system in each state, the candidates don't spend time in the states that they know they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the tight races in the swing states. For example during the campaign in 2000, seventeen states did not see the candidates at all. Voters in the twenteyfive of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad!

Further more, ""voters vote for not the president, but a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the president."" Voters cant always control who their electorss vote for. The voters sometimes even get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. If you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for Bob Smith just an example, you'd vote for a slate of thirtyfour Democratic electorss who are pledged to Bob Smith. If those electorss won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Bob would get 34 electorsal votes toward his presidency. The electorss can be anyone not holding a public office.

Did you know that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election more tham the kind of election we have now. According to the article "" a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after AI Gprethanks to the quirks of the electorsal collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO, in their time, all agreed on one thing, abolishing the Electoral College. This years voters can and will expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency, once again.

The best argument against the electorsal college is called the disaster factor. Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows for worse. "" Consider that the state legislature are technically responsible for picking electorss, and that those electorss, and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people."" In 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with brand new electors who would go against John F. Kennedy. Some faithless electorss have even refused to vote for their party's candidate and instead they vote for whoever they want.

So its official now, the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational. The name makes no sense also why is it called the Electoral ""College""? The Electoral College should just be abolished like Bob Dole said.",0
"In the world that we live in now, many people use cars to get around like getting to work, schooling, and some just go for fun, or the experience of it. In our world, these vehicles are causing a very big issue in our lives. Cars are not great for our environment, without them we would be able to be more ecofriendly, be healthier, and keep eachother more safe. Cars are not the only way to get around!

Using cars may help up get around more often, but notice how many accidents people get into. Running into someones bumper, not being carefull, and some times even driving under the influence, are all very dangerous ways you can get injured in a car. Vehicles are a way to get around quickly, but imagine being stuck in traffic for hours and only moved a mile because someone was not paying attention and ran into a street light. We were born with feet to walk. Walking short distances to the store, or market, where ever you wish to go is better than being stuck in a pile of reckless drivers. You can get there in a safer mannor than you would if you were to take a car.

There are plenty of way to get around, other than cars suck as bikes, any kind of skateboards, rollerblades, bicycling, there is a whole list. Not only do these help the environment, but they give you a nice workout. Most do it for their health, some to help them achieve a goal. A simple walk to the store, can help with a plethora of thing that are very important to your body. While doing this healthy habit, you get plenty of fresh air, with can reduce stress, and help your body in ways that will give you a feeling a peace in mind.

Lets talk about the world, we know how to stay healthy. Does our world? It cannot take care of itself. The people who live in it are the ones who provide the maintenance. Without using cars, the gas that they realese will not bother our environment. As said in source 1, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US."" 50%? Thats half! If these gasses continue to damage our environment, our world will be very unclean.

For generations, cars were known to impress. Even now, people still have cars shows, or gatherings to display their vehicles. The better your car was, the more attention you were receiving. On the other hand, many people have chosen to take the better way out of it and find other ways to get out of using them. Car pooling is another option. Not many people do it, but when its is absolutly needed, that is one option. Keeping everyone happy and healthy, including this planet, is a very important thing that we can do.",0
"Automobiles have been all anyone talks about since the 1950s. With the creation of the Model T, songs that were sung of cars like ""Mustang Sally"", and providing transportation to millions across the globe, how could they not be controversial?. But shortly after 2005, driving has not been the peak of transportation. Many countries are banning the use of motorvehicles for multiple reasons and it may not be such a bad thing.

Recently, countries have been asking their residents to either take a day or two off from driving or give up their cars overall. In Vauban, Germany, 70 percent of the families do not own a car but rather they walk or bike everywhere. Residents say they do not feel stressed out so often and are no longer tense as they were when having a car. In Bogota, the people feel the same way. The Colombian city has had a ""Day Without Cars"" event for three years and most people really enjoy the relaxation you get from not driving a car everywhere you go. More and more countries and cities are implementing this idea.

One of the major priorities right now is air pollution from gas emissions and that is why countries are slowing down motorvehicle usage. In Paris 147 micrograms of particulate matter were found, 114 in Brussels and almost 80 micrograms in London. Most of that is because of driving. With diesel fuel ranking over gasoline, we are not getting anywhere. Countries in Europe and South America have put in fines and days that people are not allowed to drive because of how bad the smog is getting in some of the areas.

The next thing countries are trying to do is increase the number of alternative transportation. How long has it been since you rode a bike? Or walked to the nearest grocery store? With the decreasing amount of people using their cars, the amount of people riding their bike or going for a walk is exploding upwards. Since the 1990s, Bogota has constructed 118 miles worth of bike paths. Sidewalks were made to a higher quality, the parks attendance rates have rapidly increased and the shopping centers are shaped up very nicely now. All because of a few days without driving.

It may seem like a burden or even a bad idea in general but if we cut down the number of motorvehicles, we can save a lot of the beautiful parts of in world and install some new ones while we're at it. The fuel is hurting the environment and everyone should help out.",0
"Dear Florida senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been around for decades, produced by the founding fathers, it was made as a compromise between the two different ways the president should be elected. One way being by a slate of senators, and another by simply popular vote. It was made so that citizens could still have their vote, but more politically advanced senators could make a decision. The Electoral College is not only more efficient but it lets the citizens keep their votes as well. I favor the Electoral College instead of popular vote because it helps avoid runoff elections, it uses the winnertakesall method, and gives equal opportunity to smaller states.

Runoff elections, as known as, the gigantic issue with a popular vote election system. In 1968, Nixon, and in 1992, Clinton, both only had about 43 percent of the popular votes which was not enough. This is a problem because it complicates the presidential election process. This is where the Electoral College comes in hand the outcome of the votes becomes very clear this way. Instead of dealing with tricky numbers and percentages, the electoral college uses the ""winnertakesall"" method. The winnertakesall method is as literal as it sounds the winner takes all. For example if someone was running for president and they got 301 votes and 370 electoral college votes, they would win you only need a majority of 270 votes to be elected.

Lastly, using the Electoral College benefits smaller states. Think of this, you live in Maine, or Hawaii, or somewhere with a smaller population than Florida or California your state would not have really that much of a impact on who wins the election. Although, you cannot choose who your state senators in the end vote for, there's a greater chance of your state having a bigger impact. It naturally balences out some of the more heavier politically impacting states. Even though things are equal, in the long run larger states population wise will get more attention than states with a smaller population.

There are upsides and downsides to the Electoral College, but from a political perspective it is crystal clear that it is a better choice. Citizens for popular vote do believe it is unfair to the voters having a board of senators making the big voteimpact on the president, but those senators are highly trusted people who know what they're doing. I favor the Electoral College over popular vote because it helps avoid runoff elections, it uses the winnertakesall method, and gives equal opportunity to smaller states.",0
"Florida State Senator, The Electoral College is a crucial part of the United state's election process. There are some negatives to the Electoral College but the positives outweigh them by a landslide. The certainty of the outcome and having a president that the majority likes are key beneficial factors to the Electoral College process that would be lost if we changed the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

With the Electoral College, there is a very rare chance that there would be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. However, according to In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" A clear winner will always be produced with the slight informality of a tie. In 2012's election, Barack Obama received 51.3% of the popular vote compared to the 61.7% of the electoral vote. If the election process was by popular vote, it would have been a much closer race between Obama and rodney.

To win the Electoral College vote, each region must like you. You cannot have a presidential candidate that favors one region and only one region favors that candidate.

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner states, ""...a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" In contrast, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer claims that even ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" What Is the Electoral College?

by the Office of the Federal Register says, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President."" Because of the number of electoral votes each state has is based on population, meaning Texas has more votes than Rhode Island, every presidential candidate focuses on winning over the big states. The big states are a better representation of our nation's opinion. The Electoral College process should not be replaced by the popular vote due to the extremely rare chance of a tie. It should remain because an outcome is certain and majority of the population would like the president.",0
"Limiting your car usage has a lot of advantages. You can do so many different things with all the space and money you save. You can save money in alot of different ways such as not having to pay car insurance, or pay for tickets, or not having to pay for gas, and lastly not having to pay for you car when it broke down and need to be repaired. With the free sapce theres so many opportunities to build new stuff so that were making good use of it. In source one it says"" In this new approach, stores are place a walk away, on a main streets, rather than in malls arounf distant highways"". This is a good thing because parents wont have to worry about where their children are, and children wont have to worry about asking their parents for rides because everything is within walking distance.

Another advantage to not using your car so much is that it can clear the air and help get rid of pollution. In source two it says""... congestion was down 60 percent"". This is really good because if we did that everywhere there would not be a problem. When you use you car to much the air starts to change. In source two it says"" cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"", Which as you can tell is not good.

When we are not using are cars we can do alot of things. In souce three it says"" parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city ', This its telling us with out the cars people are becoming more active and spending more time with there famililys and this is always a good thing. another example in source three says"" uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks"", this is good because when you do use your car its more safe on the rode and its creating more jobs. In source three it also says""new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" which creates more jobs and makes more money for the city so they can betters school and give back to the community. Inconcluson cars are not the worst thing to have because it gets you from point a to point b but in between those two points theres alot of bad things that come with it i think we should just be able to inform people that we should use our cars more wisely and to some times leave the car to be with your family.",0
"Lots of people in the world use vehicles in their daily lives but do they know what they are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Thats one of the reasons why limiting car usage would be so great for us. Another great advantage we would have by limiting car usage would be lowering stress and lowering air pollution as well,""said Carlos Arturo Plaza."" Also limiting car usage would make cities denser, and better for walking, those are the advantages of limiting car usage.

First off, limiting car usage would reduce greenhouse gases. Our cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent in car areas in the United States. That is an unbelievable percentage of greenhouse gases in Europe and an unreal percentage here in the United States. Lowering that percent would be great and alot of people would be thankful, and that would be an advantage of limiting car usage around the world.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be lowering stress and at the same time lowering pollution. If you limit car usage and just stop driving a car, grab your bike and go for a nice bike ride, it would be a good thing if you are stressed out, it will take your mind off of things and allow you to ease the stress and just relax, and while your not even thinking about it, you wouldn't be polluting the air because your on a bicycle. That is another great advantage towards limiting car usage.

Also limiting car usage would make cities denser, and allow more walking room for people to walk around instead of having to dodge vehicles. If we limit car usage, we could probably build and make more parks where people could walk and exercise, but if we have alot of vehicles driving around, how could we do that. So therefore, limiting car usage would allow us to do that and there's another advantage of vehicles being limited.

Now do you understand how limiting car usage has its advantages? Here i'll let you know again. One it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by alot. Two it can even lower stress as well as when your not even thinking about it, lowering pollution. Not driving a car and lets just say you go for a nice bike ride, that will lower your stress, it takes your mind off of things and allows you to relax, and at the same time your lowering pollution. And finally, it will makes cities denser and allow more walking room for people. Those are the advantages of limiting car usage.",0
"Over the years, people have been disputing over the Electoral College. Some people want it abolished while others want it to stay. The Electoral College is not working and and it needs to be abolished. For many reasons, the Electoral College has not worked. It is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. According to source 2, :""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The whole point of voting is so that you, along with many people, can decide who will be the next president! Voting for people to elect a president is just not right. It causes voters to not vote because they know that their vote really won't matter. Source 2 also states that candidates don't spend time in small states, ""focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" That is causing smaller states like Rhode Island and South Carolina to have less knowledge on the candidates. If I didn't know too much about a candidate, I wouldn't vote at all! Even though people in those states did vote, they might not have known a lot about the candidates and voted for the wrong person.

The people running for office want to win. Source 3 says that someone could have a higher popular vote but lose the election. Is that fair to the candidate? Winning the popular vote but losing the election? No, it isn't. Winning the popular vote means that more people want you in office. If the majority of America wants a certain person to be the president of their country, that means that the winner of the election would be the majority vote. The Electoral College deny that basic right of Americans by not letting them choose their president. That alone is unfair to the candidates and to the voters.

Now you might be saying that the Electoral College has worked for a very long time and shouldn't be changed. Although the Electoral College has been working for a long time, that is the only thing that America has tried. If America used the popular vote, it could've changed elections. The Electoral College hasn't been working because it is causing more and more voters to stop voting and it is making it where only the majority vote doesn't matter. Citizens of America should have the right to chose the president by majority vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates. As an American citizen, you have the right to vote. The Electoral College is taking that away and it needs to be stopped.",0
"Cars have been in use ever since World War II. Yet, more and more people have been limiting their usage of cars. Many take the alternative of bikes or buses, which ultimately creates benefits for not only one's self, but as well as all of the other people within the area. The benefits of limiting car usage are lowering pollution, creating less road and city congestion, and stress relief.

First of all, people have known for years that cars are a large source of air pollution. However, what most don't know is that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive area in the United States"" Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 5. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Duffer, Robert Paragraph 15. Therefore, not only do the car emissions go into the atmosphere, but it gets trapped there, so the more cars being used, the more emissions get built up and added. By limiting the usage of cars, the car emissions in the atmosphere that create air pollution can be reduced.

Secondly, many big cities have to deal with cars and traffic contesting the area. ""BOGOTA, ColombiaIn a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 20. This allowed more room for people to move along the roads and without having to worry of being hit by a car. ""Rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 28. In doing so has allowed for pedestrians to be safer when crossing roads. A benefit in which prevents a hospital bill.

Lastly, stress relief can come from limiting the usage of cars, including relieving stress. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 3. Heidrun isn't the only one who agrees that life without a car is less stressful. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife"" Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 24. Arturo and his wife were participants of the Colombian carfree day program. When you live a stressless life, it is proven that you can live longer, especially when replacing your car with exercise.

In conclusion, the benefits that come with limiting car usage are a healthier world. One, by replacing your car with exercise and relieving stress. Two, by lessening road accidents. Three, by lessening air pollution, which is not only better for the environment, but yourself. By limiting car usage, all of the benefits work out in your personal favor.",0
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winnertakeall"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, ""faithless"" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a ""winnertakeall"" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, ""..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.."", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The ""winnertakeall"" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests..."", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves.",0
"Limiting car usage comes with benefits for everything. It benefits the environment, yourself, and everyone else in the world.

If you use your car less or just use it when you need it, the amount of pollutants in the air from vehicle transportation would drop drastically. Vehicles are the second leading cause of pollution in the world behind factories. Cars are responsible for up to fifty percent of gas emissions in heavy traffic areas in the United States according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"". It is a very simple concept, cars produce gas emission, and using your car less can help protect the environment from pollutants.

The environment is not the only thing benefitted from limited car usage. You become healthier if you choose to totally lose the vehicle. Heidrun Walter stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage can also limit stress in a person. Besides being stress free, if you choose to walk to where you need to go, you exercise and do not realize it. Basically, if you want to lower your stress, not be tense, or be healthier, just limit your car usage and walk or ride a bicycle.

Vehicle accidents are a major cause of death in the world. So, if you decide to not use your car as much and just walk or bike, that is one less driver on the road. If the trend of limiting car usage and walking or biking spreads, the threats on the roadways will lower drastically. So in turn, using your car less can help keep everyone safe and help lower the amount of vehicle accidents and save lives.

With more people on the side walks, and less people behind the wheel, everyone can be benefitted. From stress to gas emission, everything can be solved with limiting your car usage.",0
"Dear State Senator, Electoral Colleges have many resources on why they should still be in favor of keeping but I strongly disagree. Changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United States is way more resourceful because Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United States and not all regions may have an opportunity to vote.

To begin with, Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president. Source 2 ""Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" states "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the president."" This quote shows that if you vote for a slate of Republicans or Democratic electors pledged the president but those electors won the statewide election, those electors would have to go to Congress and the president would get the amount of electoral votes the people have made. It's a process having Electoral College systems therefore, it's much easier having popular votes for the president.

Furthermore, Source 3 ""Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" argues ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This quote is stating that not everyone has a saying on who they want their president to be. Like people in the South may have many electoral votes but not other regions like Northeast etc. The entire community should be able vote, everyone should be able to vote. Electoral college systems shouldn't be able to reject no ones vote. Moreover, changing elections to popular votes is better because people have a chance to vote the president they want.

Electoral College systems may be in favor in many ways like the winner takes all method, or each candidate running for president having their own electors. In whatever case it may be it's not fair to people having their own votes being rejected. Like i said in my previous paragraph everyone should have a saying on whom they want their president to be.

In conclusion, I'm in favor of chaging the elections by popular votes for the president of the United States because everyone has the saying on the president they wish to have. Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United states and not all regions pf the United States have an opportunity to vote.",0
"The United States is a government that is ruled by the people through elected representatives, but do the citizens really have power? The Electoral College process does not give the citizens all of the power that they shoud be entitled to. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" p10 If a United States citizen wanted to vote for a certain candidate, they would vote for electors pledged to that candidate instead of directly voting for them. As a government who is ""run by the people"", the government surely has strict power over things that should be left up to the people to decide. The electoral college is unfair and quite confusing to the citizen of the United States. For example, one candidate beats another by a long shot with popular vote but the other candidate wins by electoral votes, the people still have not chosen the representative. The popular vote would bring honesty to the claim that we have a government who is run by the people.

A change to the election of the president by popular vote might, in fact, cause some differences and tension across the United States but would cause more relief than it would tension. The people are tired of this out dated process and demand power. Many citizens no longer vote because they think their vote does not count, that it is all up to congress and electors in the end. If the way of popular vote were to be set in place, many people would begin to vote again and would be fulfilling their civic duty. More and more people are beginning to have negative feelings towards the government and many feel like their opinions do not matter and that nothing is going to change, that it only gets worse. If enough people come together, we can change this old and unfair way of voting and everyone's opinions could make a difference in our nation.

""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference..."" p23 The electoral College is not a democratic way of voting because you are not voting for a president, you are voting for electors who in turrn, will vote for the president they want despite the people's vote. The trust that the electors will vote for the party's nominee is rarely betrayed but is still a possibility. The winnertakeall system is in each state and candidates only focus on the ""swing states"". For example, in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see candidates. Voters in 25 media markets did not see campaign ads. Popular voting will erase the unfair quality of our presidential elections and bring democratic ways back to the USA.

In conclusion, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" p14 The process in which a president is elected by popular votes is much more feesable and democratic. Many more citizens will be more likely to vote under this process thus partionally bringing the nation closer to where it should be in the modern term of democracy.",0
"Thick clouds of black smoke, and the smell of gasoline fills the air. overtime you breathe it's like your breathing poison. It's in your lungs and you cant get it out. This is our society today. Some people think that this issue is not a big deal, but in fact it is. But where is all this pollution coming from? The answer is simple, cars! Cars are the second leading polluter, in America. What these cars are doing are releasing a poisonous smog into the atmosphere, and we breathe it. Its not only killing us though, oh no. It is killing our one, our only, Earth. We are killing the only thing the human race has to live on, and for what? So we can save a couple minutes to get to work? This needs to stop. Why continue to use cars when their are so many more advantages not to use them? Without cars, or limiting the number of car usage we would save billions of dollars a year, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth.

How much money would you say you spend on gas a week? Doesn't seem like all that much right? Now add the same thing again, and again, and again. By now you are probably in the hundreds. Now picture yourself with all of that in your hand. Thats all the money you have spent on something that is gone in almost an instant. Think about all the things you could buy with that money. Sounds nice right? Well why don't you just make it a reality than? You could save hundreds in hundreds of dollars in as little as one month! You could save even more by not even buying a car! than you'd be saving a ton of money. Plus youd be doing yourself a favor. You dont need to pay for gas, insurance, repairs or even the car. This is what people in not only America are doing but also in Columbia, Bogota, and one of the worlds most beautiful cities in the world, Paris. These people are bettering themselves, and their country.

""All of our world development since world war II has been sentered on the car"" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. Just think about how much more advanced of a society we could have without cars. So many things could be created that could save lives! A cure for cancer, a solution to end world hunger, new electronics, maybe even ways to reach past the ridges of our galaxy, yet somehow we still put our focus on something that is killing us, and the Earth. Sure theres some cool tech in these new Automobils but, the only reason people by cars are for new features, or better mpg, or as said by Mr. Sivak in The End of Car Culture , ""A car is just a means of getting from A to B"", but thats all people really buy new cars, or use them for. If we wernt so focused on cars we would have new, and improved technology, and a lot more life changing discoveries.

The Earth is dying. We are killing it, and ourselves. How much gasoline can your tank hold? the real question is how much gasoline can we put into the air we breathe? This smog and pollution is destroying some of the most beautiful scenes on earth. Paris, New York, and Bejing. However the usage of these automobils are not only killing us with pollution, but with auto accidents. So many of Americans have lost their lives due to wrecks, crashes, common stupidity, and deffects in the car itself. Whats even more sad is a lot of the time the person who has lost their life is not even at fault. A lot of times when driving people tend to get stressed out. road rage is a dangerous thing. In fact Heidrun Walter exclaimed his opinion on the subject by saying ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. A very, very effective solution to this problem is to ultimitly rid them from society. A simple distraction, a buzz, beep, ring, or crash, cound end up fatal, to anyone, and everyone who gets behind the wheel. Global warming, cancer, deathes, stress, and injuries, these are all things caused by vehicles. A common thing we all learn at a young age is to eliminate the problem at the source, and change starts with you, the reader, the average civilian can make a higher than life impact on society. Don't under estimate the power each individual holds when making a difference for good.

Simple things like car pooling, walking, riding a bike, or public transportation, can all make a difference, for the better. so lets do it! lets make our environment cleaner. Our futures brighter, and our lives safer. Together we can acomplish this! we would have the advantages of saving billions of dollars a year to use for bigger and better things, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth, on our side.",0
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. ""The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century"" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? ""Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. ""During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all""Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector.",0
"Dear Florida State Senator, I am sorry to announce theat thee unfairness of thee Electoral College to thee Americna people, has come to my attention. As a fifteen year old highschool student, I will not have to worry about voting for quite some time. However, if thee Electoral College continues to be thee nation's way of electing a leader, I'm not so sure I will even have thee desire to vote when thee time comes. Having recently read several articles on the electoral college, withe information and claims bothe supporting and puting down thee Electoral College, I am now aware of what it is, and how it works. When a voter votes for thee president, thee Electoral College makes it so theey are actually voting for an elector, or someone who is supposed to vote for thee candidate chosen. Altheough, according to What Is thee Electoral College issued by thee Office of thee Federal Register, most states have a sort of ""winnertakeall"" system in which all electoral go to thee winning candidate of theat state. Electors can be anyone, according to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even thee bestlaid defenses of thee system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. How Electors are chosen depends entirely of thee state! Of course, as a senator you should be well aware of how thee Electoral College works. Are you aware of how theis affects thee American people negatively?

In civics class, students are taught thee difference between popular vote and electoral vote. However, seventhe grader do not learn thee entirety of it, seeing as learning about thee Electoral College may affect how theey see thee country theey live in. Popular vote, to my understanding, is thee number of votes a candidate recieves from thee American people. Electoral vote, thee theing theat determines who becomes president, is done by thee Electors determined when voters chose which candidate theey wanted to win. Electoral vote, and popular vote are not thee same theing, for instance one could win thee popular vote, yet lose thee electoral vote. Why is theis? Well, one can not promise theat an elector, will vote for thee same candidate theat thee American people have already chosen. Also, because of theis system, candidates tend to visit only thee ""swing"" states, instead of trying to win over thee majority of thee country, theey focus only on thee states which change periodically from red to blue! When I was younger, i used to ask my parent what would happen if a tie ever occurred during a presidential election. Now I know. In thee case of a tie, thee election is therown into thee House of Representatives, where theey theen vote on thee president. Let me explain why theis is unfair, each state only casts one vote, so a delegate from Wyoming reprents thee vote of 500,000 while a delegate from California is supposed to represent 35 million! theere is no possible way for one person to be able to speak for 500,000, everyone has theeir own opinion. Everyone belongs to a political party not everyone belongs to thee same party.

One may argue theat thee Electoral College is a good theing and must stay for thee benefit of thee American people. Withe large states such as Texas and California, swing states, runoff elections, and certainty of outcome, theey have a valid point. Of course everyone has a valid opinion, but theey would be wrong. The Electoral College is thee easy way to decide who will lead thee country, not thee best way. Today's technology can ensure a more fair way to decide thee fate of thee nation. I prepose theat popular vote be thee only way to vote for president. Withe technological advances, machines can sort therought all thee votes and determine who won. This way, thee American people can rest assured knowing theeir vote wasn't therown away because an Elector voted for thee opposing candidate.",0
"The electoral college is seen both hated and favored by many Americans. Some believe that the electoral college is an efficient way of reciving a effective president and should be continued to be utilziled in America, and others In comparsion with me agrees that the electoral college should be thrown out allowing voting to be more of an ""equal chance"". The vote really doesnt count if your electors of the state dont come to the agreement of the president you would want In the electoral college Secondly, who are the electors? And lastly who pics the electors? this is the circumstances of having the electoral college.

First off, the vote really doesnt count if your electors of the state dont come to the agreement of the president you would want. In the electoral college the citizen of that particular state vote for the president of their choice. Afterwards it would be up to the number of electors that pledged for that particular president would earn the runners a number of votes that the state has based on their population. The method used for selecting a president maybe efficient but not correct. It maybe faster and easier to calculate but which would you rather have? An not so good president that was choose by some elector. Or a vote based on what the entire country feels. Not off what a certain side of the country are most likely to do.

Secondly, who are the electors? Although these electors are trusted and rarely betrayed, how would we know if it was betrayed during this certain election? What if almost more than half of the electors in every state was influenced,forced or was to ""betray"" that would be an serious issue the election of that particular presdient. This is one of the many questions in having a electoral college. The electors can be influenced by the other electors. which cannot be good for our country. these type of decisions should be made by everyone in the country not 12, 45, or 44 electoral votes. The electoral votes were in the constitution from long ago. These type of systems worked better because the technology wasnt as advanced, but now it is. Why continue on whats already worn out, and out of date?

Lastly, how are the electors choose? Because of not always being able to control who their electors of the state choose for it really isnt accurate. If electoral college was and ""correct"" way to choose the presdient, then why arent they publicly announced? How do the people who select the electors? which brings up the possibility of the electors have a strong bias belief in democratsrepublicans. all together the electoral college sounds fishy, if everyone voted on their personal opionion there would be less choas on how the president was selected.

Although anachronism may seem like a tradtion in America, that worked when it was created and continues to work now, there are quite of few down falls of this system. things are different now, we America should adjust to the times we are living in. What worked then may not be the best possible choice due to the advancements that we nw have in america. We should be free to vote for our president directly, not through some system that is almost acient. The vote really doesnt count if your electors of the state dont come to the agreement of the president you would want In the electoral college Secondly, who are the electors? And lastly who pics the electors? This is the circumstances of having the electoral college. Maybe soon the country will see the differnce.",0
"Limiting car use can help us live better lives. The terrible smog that harms the environment called pollution is caused by the excessive use of vehicles in communities. I believe limiting car use can help us reduce pollution, more accessibility to public transportation, and helps you save money. Reducing the use of vehicles can help the environment. Join in and make the world a better place, literally.

With less cars being used in communities the risk of pollution can be decreased. When you don't use your car you help the environment. People use cars to go to places they can easily walk to, but they don't. Some people don't even care about the environment or if they harm it. By reducing the car use in many communities pollution can be greatly reduced.

Public transportation is cheap and quick. Using more public transportation helps you save money and helps the environment. Pollution can be reduced by just taking the bus instead of your own car. According to ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky more people tend to get the initiative to take public transportation. You don't have to do something extraordinary to help the environment, maybe all you need to do is take the bus.

People tend to buy less cars if you limit car usage. The less cars you buy means the more money you save. According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal a study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. The people who drove less between that time must have saved lot of money on gasoline. When you don't use your car as much it ends up benefiting everybody.

By limiting the usage of cars the environment benefits a great deal. Pollution can be reduced to a point where it causes minimal harm if everybody decides to pitch in. Transportation will receive more funding. You will be able to save plenty of money on gas and use it for whatever other purpose you may need it. In conclusion, car usage should be reduced so that everyone may benefit from it.",0
"For many years people have been debating whether or not to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. According to source 1, the electoral college was established as ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" There are few positive effects of the Electoral College, however, there are many negative effects. I am in favor of changing the United States' election process to election by popular vote because there are many risks with the Electoral College, the Electoral College is outdated, and lastly, the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many states.

Currently, while using the Electoral College, the United States takes multiple risks. Some of the major risks were stated in source two. One of the major risks included, what of the elector put the vote in for the candidate he wished? Of course no matter what the situation, there will be risks to take. However, when those risks become actions, and happen more than once, people put up a guard and start to question whether or not the process is trustworthy. A sentence in source three declared, ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Americans are expected to trust a slate of electors whom we know little about personally, and trust is a personal thing. Trust is something that has to be earned. Therefore, when our trust is betrayed more than once because of the process the Electoral College, there is no way to earn that trust back once again. Without the Electoral College, this would not be an issue.

Not only is the Electoral College risky, but it is also outdated. The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers, over a century ago. With new technology, and new systems forming, the election process should be more modern. Also, when it was decided to use the Electoral College, there were fewer people in the United States. Currently, in modern day, the population is much greater. A country with a greater population needs a modern election selection.

The Electoral College is very unfair to states that do not have the ability to make an impact in the election. If the election process were changed to elected by popular vote, smaller states would have the ability to make their vote matter.

The Electoral College needs to be changed immediately in able for citizens to stop worrying about taking major risks, so our country as more of a modern election process, and so every vote counts. Changing to election by popular vote could make the United States a better country.",0
"From Monster trucks to Volkswagen Beetles, all automobiles are created to make life easier for people from all corners of the Earth. Many people start up their cars everyday without a second thought, whether trekking across the street or across the country. Others believe that cars are ruining the Earth, and put effort toward decreasing their car's ""footprint"" on the environment. People everywhere should consider limiting their car usage.

A community with less cars has proven to also be one with less healthy citizens. According to Source Two, Paris, a city known for it's aromatic scents, was covered with the smell and appearance of smog for days they had nearrecord pollution: Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. After a day in which all evennumbered license plates were banned from the streets of Paris, the smog cleared up a great amount enough for the city officials to take the ban they had placed for odd numbered license plates the next day. The smog that was affecting the wellbeing of Paris' citizens had mostly disappeared after only one day of limited car use. If a community limits cars, its inhabitants will be almost forced to exercise more. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, where a ""Day Without Cars"" is held yearly, 118 miles of bike paths have been constructed, the most of any Latin American city. Less cars on the road in this city have led to other means of transportation being more popular, including walking and bicycling. These ways of getting around are much more healthy then their gaspowered alternative. Less traffic on roads will therefore leave cities healthier than otherwise.

There are many more reasons why citizens should limit their personal car use. Owning a car is huge investment. You have to pay for gas and oil refills for any standard car based on how much it is driven. Because of this, limiting car use would also limit the pressure on car owner's wallets. According to Source One, the majority of residents of Vauban, Germany don't have cars. This city is an example of a worldwide effort to make suburbs denser. Because of this there is no need for automobiles to commute across the city. The purchase of a car, which costs thousands to even millions of American dollars for the average buyer, is unecesssary for the residents of this town and therefore can lead to better financial stability.

Cardriving, the catalyst to the wonders of travel, will continue to drive on the pollution of our Earth. Babysitters, doctors, students, and even the retired will thrive from limitations of car usage. Whether by limiting car usage or not, Earth's inhabitants need to ensure their planet is treated right.",0
"Dear senator, I am not in favor of the electoral college. The electoral college may seem helpful in some ways in terms of voting, but not entirely. Think of it this way you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether or not your votes are making a difference because you have no control over who the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.

Our county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no power for who is elected, does not help the case of being called ""corrupt"" or ""incorrect"". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the electors cast their vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.

In addition to the fact the American people do not hace full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.

In paragraph eleven, it states that ""legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.

Take into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The popular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The popular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election. In paragraph 16 of the article, it states that ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed..."" Yes this trust may rarely be betrayed, but it is entirely possible. Just because it does not happen often, does not mean it is impossible...and who knows? What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?

Finally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system. Trust can always be betrayed, even if it does not happen often it can still happen without our knowledge. The people residing in the United States and under the laws of our country do not have full control on who is elected as president. I am, however in favor of election by popular vote. This means that a state casts its vote based on who the majority has voted for, and I truly believe this would system would best suit our country.",0
"Cars. Everyday the average citizen uses a car to get around wether it be for groceries or just going to their job. It has gotten to the point that many people cannot imagine the idea of living without a car. For those few people who have made the switch to not using a car daily however, have experienced some good things about life without a car. In the passage set it explores the different positive side effects that can come along with not having a car from real life situations. There are many different things that can happen with just this one change and some of these examples you might not have thought about before.

The first two sources talk mostly about the environmental changes that having no cars could bring. Source one focuses on the greenhouse gasses that are produced from car usage. The article states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" This is a huge deal because greenhouse gasses are believed to be responsible for global warming which could become a huge threat. Source two continues to bring up the air pollution problems that are occurring in places around the world. Air pollution can cause a variety of problems from people having problems breathing to plants dieing. The problem has gotten so bad that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". The problem of smog has gotten so serious that a whole community had to ban driving which is insane that it's gotten that far. Limiting car usage could take car of our Earth the way it takes care of us.

The last two sources, sources 3 and 4, look at the way that limiting car usage could improve our communities. Source three talks about how that cutting back on car usage could benefit different parts of our surroundings. Near the end of the passage it says ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"". It then continues to list off individual things like rush hour traffic being cut down and sidewalks that were in poor condition are perfect again. The last source talks about the economic benefits that having less cars operating could bring. As a result of the recession people were forced to get creative on how to save money in order to get by. One thing we did was cut back on the amount of gasoline we used which in turn led to us cutting back on the amount of driving we did. This boosted our economy and there in no reason why it can't continue to boost our economy even further if we cut back our car usage even further.

In conclusion cutting back on how much we use our cars has many advantages that will benefit every person living today. There are even more advantages that were not mentioned in the sources above that will improve the world even more. Along with there being a ton of advantages, there are little to no disadvantages. Think to yourself of at least four advantages of increasing the amount of car usage.",0
"Dear, senator I believe the electoral college was a useful tool in the past ,but is now an out date system that should be changed. If we continue to use this system we aren't really giving the people a fair chance to vote for who they want. For example in California a more democratic state republicans may be lessen the incentive to vote knowing that there vote will not have an effect. This raise another issue, which is not everybody is voting and it is not all a right but a prestige among US citizens every where. The electoral college was elective in the past because we did not have the technology to count all the votes from each state, but now we do so we can only go by the popular vote.

The popular vote is more effective and I'm not the only one who thinks so over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Al Gore thanks to the electoral college won the popular vot but lost the electoral, how is it that some one could win more votes from most voters ,but still lose? The answer is the electoral college, the reason is that you are not voting as a indiviual person but as a state. This brings me back to California and how republicans votes don't count because the state voted democrat.

Though the electors should do there job and vote with the state they could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationist nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So please take into consideration that your vote may not have an effect on the election if we don't change the system.",0
"Dear Senator, The electoral college has existed for many years till now and has been used to elect the presidents of the United States of America, clearly this form of electing a president is outdated. Senator, You must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because the electoral college is unfair, and irrational.

Senator you must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because it is unfair. This is true because under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a state senator who in turn elects the president. For example a person living in Texas that wanted to vote for John Kerry would have to vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would then receive his 34 electoral votes. Because of this system voters cant control who the electors vote for, and sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college isn only unfair to the voters but also to the men and women who are competing in the elections, for example in the 2000 U.S presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266 electoral votes. This is why you must replace the electoral college Mr. Senator.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is irrational to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on swing states. Seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign add. the electoral college is irrational because given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house of representatives can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people, and if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this senator in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophie. This is why you must replace the electoral college due to its irrationalism.

Its quite clear State senator, the electoral college is unfair and irrational, the best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. This is why you must abolish the electoral college.",0
"The Electoral College, established by the Founding Fathers within the Constitution, was meant to serve as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of citizens. What the founding fathers failed to see was the many outstanding flaws within the Electoral College. For many imperative reasons that cannot be avoided, elections must be changed to the method of popular vote, and the Electoral College must not be a part of the United states elections any longer.

The first and foremost reason why the Electoral College should no longer be kept in the U.S is because it will only lead to negative consequences. This has been observed in the past, and it must be prevented from occurring once more. One element of this disaster factor is that electors could defy the will of the people. Source 2 informs readers that state legislators are are technically responsible for picking electors. These electors could very easily decide to vote upon who they would like to see in office, rather than who the citizens want. The impact of this would be treacherous when the wrong person is elected as president. Source two quotes, ""Back in 1960, segregationsists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. How is that for a compromise between Congress and U.S voters? Furthermore, another way in which keeping the Electoral College would be disastrous would be seen in the case of a state sending two states of electors. Bradford Plumer reminded those in favor of the Electoral College that this has happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, enormous downfall was avoided because Vice President Richard Nixon, presided over the Senate, validated his opponent's electors and did so ""without establishing a precedent."" However, America may not be so lucky the next time this may take place. Senators in each and every state must open their eyes and really see what is happening in their country. The U.S must change its elections to the popular vote system, where all of these impacts will be avoided. The Electoral College does nothing for its citizens, and states may send two states of electors to it, and for these reasons, America will face a very unhappy situation if we keep this system.

Popular vote is a much better system than the Electoral College because unlike the Electoral College, it is actually fair for its citizens. America, which has suffered greatly to achieve equality and liberty is held back by one thing the Electoral College. This is suffered by the United states citizens because of the College's winnertakeall system. Through this, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Source 2 refers back to the 2000 campaign, saying, ""...seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" How can a president be properly elected with this system in place? Source 3 attempts to discredit this claim, aguing, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign..."" What they fail to realize is that those citizens may not even know who they are voting for! It is lucid that there is simply no valid argument for outting the fate of the presidency into the hands of a couple swing voters in a state. In addition, as far as being unfair goes, there are also unpredicatable scenerios that may occur in elections. These scenerios are far from fair to anybody. For instance, there is always the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that were to happen, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives where voting would be handed over to state delegations. Plumer quotes, ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to...unfair."" This would not happen if the U.S adopts the popular vote method, where the most popular candidate will win and reflect the citizens who placed him or her into office. The Electoral College is nothing other than unfair to the citizens who rely on it to elect their president.

For many reasons, election methods must be changed to popular vote, and the Electoral College must be disgarded. It will only lead to a profound disaster, and it is also extremely biased and unfair. The United States must take action, one state at a time, to reverse the negative path it is on. This is the only way the U.S can finally reach its long term goal complete prosperity.",0
"Dear state senator, I write to argue in favor of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source ""widely regarded as an anchronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner."" That was in my opinion pretty self explanatory. This letter is based on information from article sourses I read.

First of all, I would like to start by saying that the Electoral College is helpful to avoid problems where no candidate got a majority. For example in the 5th part of the source 3 it says ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively"" which backs up my claim. I understand the ""wrong"" part of it like in the 2nd source it says ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" meaning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. Honestly I dont see it as that ""wrong"" but thats my opinion.

Second, I agree with the Electoral College despite the lack of ""democratic pedigree"" for five reasons. First, ""Certainty of Outcome"" meaning winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote, example, Obama is rodney. Second, in the Everyone's President part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, ""rodney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"". Number 3, ""Swing States"" the ""winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesas we saw in 2012 electionto focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states"". There is also number 4 where the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" amnd there is number 5, ""Avoid RunOff Elections"" which is what I used in the second paragraph as a claim.

In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it. Well thank you for taking the time to read through this.",0
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, ""... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency."" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there.",0
"Automobiles are one of the most dramatic and resourceful products of the Industrial Revolution. They help people commute from one place to another, allow for travel time to decrease, and help citizens carry heavy objects from point A to point B. Only, did we think about the negative effect it could have on our environment? Forests are cut down to build highways, accidents are caused when the driver fails to pay proper attention to what he or she is doing, and greenhouse gases have overridden our atmosphere with choking smog. Many Americans rely on their cars, but have we thought about the positive of limiting our car usage? We as fellow citizens have a substantial amount of advantages if we simply limit our car usage to help create a better environment, for us, for the community, and for those to come.

One advantage of limited car usage is a better quality of life for a person. When a person has the responsibility of a car, they must make sure all of the parts are working properly, know how to operate the car safely, know exactly which routes to take that are safest for the car and for themself, know exactly how to fix the car in case something malfunctions, the list continues. This causes the person to become overwhelmed and stressed due to the needs of their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in ""The End of Car Culture"" that, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession find little reason to resume the habit"" Rosenthal, paragraph 8. Basically, people who limited their use of cars were more relaxed and found no good reason to return to their habit of using a car. furthermore, with more people limiting their car usage, the more they use local stores and shops that are walking or biking distance. Rosenthal also states ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" , ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls..."" Rosenthal, paragraph 6. In other words, businesses florish due to their locations and promote citizens to limit their car usage due to their distance to travel. This also allows for more people to acknowledge their cities and allow them to become cleaner and beautiful.

Similar to the first, another advantage is for the betterment of the city. According to ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""... Beijing, China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" Duffer, paragraph 5. This is due to Beijing's huge population tourist and regular and their increased use of cars on a daily basis. In other words, smog due to passenger cars in one of the leading causes of pollution in our society. The cars are, literally, choking us and future generation to the point where we won't be able to breathe. Limited car usage allows for the reduction of greenhouse emmisions and smog, allowing for oxygen to circulate and breathe life into us and our children. As a result of reduced greenhouse emmisions, cities become cleaner and more beautiful. As stated by Andrew Selsky in ""Carfree day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota"" , ""Parks and sports senters also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have croopped up"" Selsky, paragraph 15. Basically, the limited use of cars has allowed the city to florish and reconstruct itself into something beautiful and strong for the community to enjoy.

The limited use of cars has allowed for the betterment of the community and of cities across the globe and many people are taking advantage of this new era coming into play. The health of people has improved and the pollution that makes up our atmosphere has decreased in a slow, but steady stream. Imagine how much better the environment would be once the use of cars is limited to less than one perent of the population. The future is bright and we only need to strive for it, without headlights.",0
"Voting time is here again and its time to cast your vote for the president, but do you know what really happened when you vote? See the United States Constitution has this process set that the election of a president consists of the selection of electors and each state has electors based on population. Citizens vote for the electors candidate and the electors take the majority of the votes whether it be democratic or Republican and all votes of that states electoral representatives vote for the states winning president. Crazy right? But is that the most effective way to this and if it is not the why shouldnt we change it to something more fare and equal and not leave it up to some special electors. Leave it to the people to decide who we want for our president.

The United states is a fairly new country compared to others around our world yet we have some pretty advanced technologies and some really brilent ideas but when our founding fathers made the Constitution I dont think they made the best choice. Even some of our previous presidents like Nixon, Carter, Dole, Chamber of Commerce and the AFLCIO have said we need a better way to elect our presidents. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote and was set on presidency but did not win thanks to this outrageous system and lost the electoral vote and lost his shot at precedence. If you win the popular vote doesn that mean your the fan favorite and the citizens want you to be president because the majority voted for you. During a pole shortly after Gore lost people were asked if we should keep the system we have now or chang and 60% of the people asked said that we should change. Cant you see the people are cying our for help and asking to change the system so someone like Gore doesn get cheater again.

When campaigning as a president shouldnt you try to visit every state to try and increase yo popularity? Well sadly it really doesn work like that with this current system you see some presidents lets take Obama and rodney as and example. Some states wont see the candidates at all because they ""know"" they will win the electoral votes. Obama in the 2012 election never visited some states like Ohio or rodney and flordia because they knew that the majority would vote for him and he would win that state. Now how is that fair. If it was up to just a popularity vote each president campaigning would go to every stae trying to get as many voters as possible instead they say eh i will skip that state because I will get the majority any ways. On top of the the electoral system makes smaller states less important because it is set up where more population means more votes. That to me is saying well you a small state so everyone in that stae you mean way less that this other state. California, Texas, and Flordia are the most campianed states in the US because they have 55,38,29 votes respectivley. now places like Arizona, Ohio, north and south Dakota have six, three, three, and three respectivley. how is any of these people less important adn less aluable the the ones in California, Texas or Flordia.

I still cant find a reason why we should keep this sytem around and the more I think about it the more I want to get rid of it. The electoral college is taking our power as US citizens our of our hands and defies us from voting for the president and in turn makes us vote for special offece people. I say leave the electoral system and change to a popular vote wins presedency. This puts power where it should belong, in the hands of the citizens. Who else is with me on abanding the old way and taking a new step in the direction of power to the people.",0
"Dear state senator, Ever since 1776, The United States of America has been a great example of freedom, excellence, and democracy. After all, the U.S. is one of the biggest supporters of democracy, and is all about the rights of their people. So imagine my shock to learn that this country, in fact, does not rely on it's people to vote for their leader. Which, to many people would be the simplest form of freedom out there. Instead, we have the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a number of electors that represent a state. ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register In this quote, it explains that the Electoral College is based on the existing population in your state therefore, the more people you have, the more electors the state receives. However, this sounds great and all, but in my opinion, a direct democracy would work great for this country because it would generate just representation of the people by allowing them to make the vote, encourage voters and remind them that they have a voice, and immediately destroy the chances of a representative to vote for an opposing candidate.

America is all about their people. And of course, the government wants to do what's best for them, right? Voting is a right that American citizens achieve when they reach the matured age of eighteen. It's supposed to feel like a blessing that we get to decide and have a voice in the process of election. But, with the Electoral College, it ""...may turn off potential voters of a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner So the citizens of this country are beginning to feel like their say in this decision will have little to no impact. This will affect the amount of voters and will ultimately cause a huge problem in the way people feel about representation.

Enough about the people, how about the electors? ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer This means that not even when the people vote for all their electors and they should be selecting the correct candidate, they may change their minds. Electors are people too, and people may have their opinions swayed and then the electors could vote for the other candidate. It is scary to think that the candidate everyone chose and was rooting for might not win because someone decided to make a different decision.

And some people might stand up for the Electoral College, say that ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates...to focus their campain efforts on the tossup states."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner It later goes on to say that because of this, the citizens in the Swing States become the most thoughtful voters because they receive the most information on the candidates. However, wouldn't we, as a country, prefer all of our potential voters to be informed and wellaware of our candidates? ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states...focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer Why should the fate of the presidency be laid in the hands of such a small amount of people when our country is meant to be for everybody in the land?

As a concluding statement, senator, I want you to consider my argument that we'd be better off without the Electoral College because citizens should be able to decide who they want to run, they should feel important, they should all be wellinformed, and electors that change their minds wouldn't even be a problem anymore. Thank you for taking the time to consider my letter.",0
"Dear State Senator, I send you this letter to bring up an issue that is often debated amongst us Americans. Should we kee the Electoral College? No! The electoral college just doesn't work anymore and we have seen that in the past. You probably ask yourself what is wrong with the Electoral College? The problem with the Electoral College is that it is unfair, it doesn't rely on what the people say and it can sometimes really make the public mad.

The Electoral College is really unfair, especially for voters. We vote for who WE want, not for some other guy to say what we want. Voters want THEIR voice to be heard when they vote not someone else's. When we vote for a presidential candidate we want to vote directly for who we are voting, we want to pick who we want directly. In source 2 the article explains how the Electoral College works. The author says ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What this means is that when you voted for Obama you didn't vote for Obama , you voted for a group of people to vote for who they wanted. So your voice was not heard. Don't you find that unfair to the voters and to the candidates?

overtime one person votes for a certain presidential candidate, they are basically ignored. The President should be chosen by the people! And at the moment the President is being chosen by politicians who will ""represent"" us and repeat what we say although that has been proven to not always be true. Passage 2 reminds us of the incidence in the 2000 election in which Al Gore lost the presidency to George W. Bush by electoral votes, even though he had more individual votes. This proves that our state representatives will not always represent us how we want them to, but how they want to represent us. This is the reason why voters need a direct voice from them to picking their leaders. We should pick what we want not what some politicians want. You are probably saying that these incidents do not happen very often, as said in source 3. The article says ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000...but that was the first time since 1888"" This says that situations like this are very rare, yet it is still possible. Even so, wouldn't you rather the people be heard rather than a politician that claims to represent his state?

So many people got mad in 2000 when they just chose the president most people didn't want. There's many ways to make us Americans mad and this is just another one of those ways. In the United States you are supposed to be able to choose what you believe to be right. If you want to choose what you think should be the future's right president then you should be able to pick him and not have to expect anyone's approval or opinion on your vote. You should be able to walk out from the voting center and say I voted for this guy. Eventually keeping the Electoral College will only cause more problems, because as time goes on the human develops its opinion futher and creates and spreads new ideas meaning that there will be more people picking different things. If you think that what you are picking should be picked you should be able to say ""I want that"" and not have to through the bother knowing that a politician may have chosen what you DON'T want. If you want to make Americans mad, then keep the Electoral College.

In conclusion I think that the Electoral College be removed and the use of popular vote be put into effect because the Electoral College is unfair, it does not reply on what the public says and it makes the Americans mad. Please take this letter into consideration.",0
"Dear state senator, I theink thee Electoral College should stay because like most well educated Americans thee people of thee Electoral College know who theey want to lead theis country. Most Americans complain about how theere vote doesn't matter but it really does. Your vote is what's making thee electors decied on who should lead America.

The Electoral College is a group of well educated people theat understand congress better thean thee average American citizen. In order to choose thee right leader we need to have thee highly qualified people for thee job. Most Americans don't know what toppings to put on theeir pizzas, now imagine what kind of trouble theey would have choosing someone to run our country. when you vote you don't vote for thee president or thee secretary of state or thee governor, you vote for a slate of electors theat theen choose who to elect as thee leader of thee country, state, or city. thee Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic metheod of selecting a president theat ought to be overruled by declaring thee candidate who recieves thee most popular votes thee winner. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for thee party's nominee and thee trust is rarely betrayed.

There are 5 reasons for retaining thee Electoral College.

A dispute over thee outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it is less likely thean a dispute over the popular vote.

2. Everyone's President The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a regional favorite, such as Mitt rodney was in thee southe, has no incentive to campaign heavily in theose states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states theat he knows he's more favorited to win in. theis is a desirable result because a candidate withe only regional appeal is unlikely to become a successful president.

3. Swing States The winnertakeall metheod of awarding electoral votes induces thee candidates to focus theeir campaign efforts on thee tossup states. Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to thee campaign knowing theat theey're going to decide thee election. They are likely to be thee most theoughtful voters and thee most theoughtful voters are thee ones theat are going to be deciding thee election.

4. Big States A large state usually gets more attention from presidential candidates theen thee smaller states 5. Avoid RunOff Elections There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of thee votes cast theat pressure, which would greatly complicate thee presidential election procces, is reduced by thee Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

A good precentage of Americans want thee Electoral college to be gone but i theink theat thee Electoral College should keep doing what it is doing because theey know how to choose thee right candidate and theey have a great 5 step procces to choose who should lead thee United States.",0
"There is a new era in driving. people from all around the contry are either cutting down on driving or getting rid of there cars all together. I think that cutting back on te usage of driving a car will get people to find new ways of travel and also cut down on green house gas emissions.

There are many reasons to cut down on the driving of cars. one of these reasons is to find new ways of traveling. I'm not the only one who feels this way. there are many up and coming communitys enforcing the same idea but actual doing somthing to enforce it. ""70 percent of vaughn's families don not own cars and 57 percent of the family sold there car to move there""source 1as you can see i am not the onlyone with these belifs this neighborhood has set up certain rules and restrictions to make sure that people are either finding a place to store there car and walk and find a new means of transportation or they are selling there cars all together. Another way people like this are preventing people from driving or buying cars is they make it extremely expensive to park and store your car. like it says in source 1""car ownership is aloud but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development where car owners buy a space for 40,000 dollars,along with a home""so as you can see even though they are not making driving impossible but they are making it extremely hard to indulge in that process.

Another reason that i think we should cut down or completly get rid of driving and cas is to cut down on green house gas emissions. in the second source it says ""paris had 147 micrograms of particulate mater or PM. compared to other countries in the world that only have 114 or 79 micrograms PM."" source 2 this goes to show that just one of the smaller cities in a smaller contrie is emitting this much pollution into the air imagine how much the U.S is or china is emitting daily. when paris found out abot this they made sure that no one was driving for the next few days to ""clear the air"". and when the driving ban lifted there was already an increase in the clenleness of the air after only a few days of not a lot of people driving. And the people who were caught driving were givin a fine for driving. if we want to stop the green house gas emissions we as a contry and even a world need to find ways like what paris did to ""clear the air"" cars alone make up 12% of the green house gas emissions. now imagine our contry and planet if we were to completly cut out that 12% percent. we can do that as long as we can come up with ways and guide lines and rules to limit the use of cars.

to wrap up,i think as a contry and as a planet we need to come up with new ways and ideas on how to limit the use of cars and the green house gas emissions. and the only way to do that is to give people other options on diffrent ways of travel and to show them the statistics of how bad cars actualy are for the enviroment.",0
"From the early 2000's to the present day, the number of people who own cars throughout Europe and the United States has gone down. Although personal motorized vehicles can be convenient to own and use, there are many advantages to not owning a car, such as a decrease in air pollution, experiencing other sources of transportation, and an overall cultural shift.

Air pollution is a big issue all around the world. Cars are responsible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in some highly populated areas in the United States. Cities such as Paris have banned cars for a few days in order to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted into their atmosphere. Congestion of environmentally damaging gases went down by sixty percent in Paris after their cleanse, where as before the cleanse, they were suffering through five straight days of heavy smog. Cars are the second most source for carbon emission in the United States. Lower amounts of cars owned results in less pollution in the air, which creates an all around better environment, a huge advantage.

Without personal cars, people resort to using other new and exciting forms of transportation such as biking, walking, hiking, or using buses, taxis, or the transit. In Vauban, Germany, the residents live a new lifestyle without personal cars. The community is small, and there are just a few streets that are easily accessible. The residents in the community experience a life that is close to the people around them. In Bogota, Columbia, once a year they have a carfree day, where the population must find other ways to get around instead of their personal vehicles. The carfree day is very popular, and as a result, has allowed the city to invest in one hundred and eighteen miles of new bike paths and sidewalks, new parks, and new sports centers. In the United States, some people decide to just set up their life around their home. Everything they have to get to is within walking distance of their home. The number of miles driven peaked in 2005, and then declined heavily afterward. In New York, the bike sharing program and the car pooling programs have allowed for less personal car use. Driving by teenagers all throughout the United States has decreased by twentythree percent between 2001 and 2009.

The decrease in personal vehicle use is leading to a revolutionary cultural change that is crossing borders and making it's way around the world. Since World War II, the development of the world has revolved around the car, but that will soon change. From Vauban, Germany, where there is no car use at all, to the United States, where in 2013, the number of miles driven per person was equal to that of 1995, this cultural change is making it's way into each home. Some explanations for this change are the internet and city centers. The internet allows people to feel connected to family and friends without having to drive to see them. City centers have made the suburbs less populated, which results in less driving back and forth. Some possible results from a cultural shift away from the use of personal cars are less dependence on the car industry, and overall smaller, closer, and more communitydriven cities based around transportation such as biking and walking. In the long run, this cultural shift would be an advantage to the world.

In Europe and the United States, many people have already made the shift away from personal car usage. People of the world can partake in a cultural change of less car usage, experiencing different forms of transportation, and all the while positively affecting their environment.",0
"Driving at times can be a really big issue to deal with. There are so many thing that can go wrong, a crash, then increase in insurance, you might even get your license taken away after that. When you don't drive, the world is an open book just waiting to be read. Walking or riding bikes can relieve stress and make you more fit and in shape. The gasses that come from cars are just aweful for the environment, and there would be such a largly reduced number in traffic jams if people would just get off the road. Once your on the road, anything can happen. It's dangerous, i sometimes even wonder if i really want a license.

When you drive there are so many traffic jams. The idea of never having to worry about traffic again is intriguing. Why worry about having to rush through traffic just to get to work on time, when instead you can simply manage your time correctly and walk at the pace you are comfortable with. Traffic jams cause accidents that put peoples lives at risk. In the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in booga"" by Andrew Selsky, he states, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The carfree day in Colombia is working to perfection to promote alternative transportation, i don't see why we dont have this in the United States.

driving causes stress and tension and that's never good. A stressed driver is a dangerous driver, when you're stressed you become more careless and less aware of your surroundings and that is very dangerous as a driver it leads to reckless driving and accidents. Being without a car relieves this stress for many people. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a quote from the article states, ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. This shows that cars are a lot to handle and that most people just believe it is too much stress for one person to deal with.

The smog and pollution caused by all the cars that are on the road these days is another reason why it is best to stay off the road. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". The cities ban on cars on the road shows a serious concern in the saftey of the people because of all the smog that driving has caused.

Some people might argue that cars would be faster, but if you take a car you are going to be mor at risk of an accident, you're going to be polluting the air, and you'll only be stressing yourself out in the process. I strongly suggest that America does something to change our ways, because if we don't, we'll end up like Beijing and Paris with an extremly high pollution rate.",0
"You're running late for work, but you still have to drop the kids off at work. Or maybe you overslept and have to get to school soon. You get everything ready for the day, jump into your car, and you drive off. Cars are very important in todays society, but limiting your car usage can have its advantages. Reducing the amount of times you use your car could help the environment, the economy, and the development of the city you are living in.

Pollution is a topic that is heard of everywhere, yet we don't take action to prevent it. Limiting your car usage could help contribute to helping the world get rid of pollution in the air. Paris typically has mor smog than other European capitals due to their usage of diesel fuel. Diesels make up about 67 percent of vehicles in France. Paris has tried to stop people from using their cars so much and is fining them if they are. Eventually, due to so much smog and diesel usage, people will have to stop using their cars so much if they want to be abe to see where they're going when driving.

The economy will benefit from the limited usage of cars. Think about it, if we use our cars less, we don't run out of gas as fast as we usually would. If we don't run out of gas, we don't spend as much money trying to fill the tank. If we don't buy as much gas, the price of gas will decrease due to the amount the pipelines are able to store and generate at the same time. If we limit our usage of vehicles, insurance costs will decrease because people are not driving as often and there aren't as many accidents happening.

The development of the city you live in will change in a good way for you if you limit the usage of your vehicles. It used to be that people in the old days wanted to move out as far as possible from their neighbors for ""space"". The areas and cities just kept on expanding an dit would take longer to get somewhere in town. People wanted to live in suburban and have a job in the city. This increased the usage of cars and other vehicles. Now, people are starting to move back into the city, amking it denser. Once you live in the city, you wouldn't have to use your car to go grocery shopping because there is a public or walmart right across the street from you. People in these dense cities will start to walk or ride their bikes to work.

Parents wouldn't have to worry about being late and still having to drop of their kids. While the parent is able to drive twice toandfrom work, the kids could go toandfrom school by walkin or riding their bikes. This cuts off the usage off the car. Instead of dropping of the kids and then going to work and then going to pick the kids up and then head home, know you won't have to do that.

Limiting the amount of time you use your car for can help the world and yourself. You save money, time, and the planet all at once by using your vehicles less. On the outskirts of Freiburg, Germany, residents in a community are forbidden of street parking, driveways, and home garages. Car ownership is allowed, but you would have to park in a large garage at the edge of the development. Along with this, you eould pay 40,000, with a home, to be a car owner. These methods are being used more and more to stop the great and unreasonable usage of cars.",0
"The four passages provided explain that less and less people are buying cars and obtaining licences because of the multiple advantages it provides such as reduced pollution, reduced stress, and reduced traffic.

All, four passages mention that an up side of limiting car usage would reduce pollution around the world. In paragraph five it mentions that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states."" By reducing the amount of cars driven in these areas we could reduce the amount of pollution. Due to large amounts of smog created by pollution in France, banning was put on drivers with even license plates for one day. This is shown in paragraph 19, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" This shows how much can change in just one carfree day.

Not driving cars can also reduce stress. The families in Vauban, Germany experience less stress when not driving and instead walk or ride a bike. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two stated in paragraph three, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" Even though this is just one opinion, it is safe to say that the other residents in the community are feeling the same way. In Bogota, Columbia a carfree day has been that has been held annually for three years has a businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza saying in paragraph 24 ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.'"" Not driving cars obviously is a way of lowering stress.

Finnaly, not driving can reduce traffic in heavly populated areas. In paragraph 14 it shows how not driving can reduce traffic, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog."" In just five days traffic was down 60 percent! Imagine what a few carfree weeks or months could do. Again back to Bogota, Columbia, paragraph 20 states ""...Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This shows that carfree days can even be done in large cities.

In the end, even though life without cars would be difficult there are many more pros than cons to living without cars. The pros being less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.",0
"Smog, acid rain, high carbondioxide levels, all of these things are due to pollution. In many countries the leaders have put a ban towards cars. Paris France, Vauban Germany, Bogota Colombia, and even the United States of America haveare thinking about putting a ban on cars or other transporting objects. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage limiting pollutians in the air, saving money, and having a healthier life style.

Cars can cost a pretty penny epically if their new, and many lowmiddle class family's have trouble keeping up with the bills that come with a car. Car payments alone can run up to 300 a month. Then theirs insurance, and if your car happends to need a change of oil, or breaks theirs another 200300 dollar payment. That's why people are starting to buy fewer and fewer cars each year. After the peek in 2005 car percheses have droped tremendously, with less people deciding to get a license.

Not getting you license dosn't mean you cant get around, it just means that you have to find other means of transportation. Biking, walking, even riding on your skateboard can get you from point A to point B. Cars are bigining to become obsolete, not being used in large suburbs, or highly populated cities. People have started to walk to work and that has a largee impact on health. With people having privet cars they dont feel the need to have physical activity every day. This could be contributing to obesity. With cars being out of mind people are starting to get exersize just by walking to work. Cars have also contributed to many deaths all over the world. With new technology coming out many drivers get distracted. Wether its talking on their phones, trying to pick up something thats' dropped in the back seat, or even trying to dig something out of your purse. Not all drivers are a fault tho, many other accidents happen because of pedestrians not paying attention. These accidents could be prevented though, by just getting rid of the use of cars.

Passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gass additions in europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the Unites States. If we got rid of most privetly owned cars though, it world bring that pecentige down tremendously. In Paris the record high pollution finally had them pass a partial driving ban untill the thick smog cleard the city streets. congestion was down 60% in the streets of paris, and after 5 days of intensifying smog it had finally cleard.

Cars all over the world are slowly becoming less and less used. This could help the pollution, health and save money. these advantiges to getting rid of cars is going to become a topic thast we will talk alot about for ages, until cars become compleetly and totaly obsolite.",0
"Dear senator, Imagine it being the year for choosing for a new president for the United States of America. You cast your vote, for which president you thought that would be best to run our country. After, you hear the results you become very disappointed , Because the president won not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. You become very angry and frustrated because the president that will now be running for America will not better our country by the things he said. Reasoning, that he won by the electoral college and not by popular vote, and you feel as if you dont feel as if it was not fair because you're not really choosing based on the state laws and how the electors are selected. How would you feel if you were in a situation like this ?

Furthermore, i think we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. My reasoning being said is because when the president wins by popular vote it's from what the american citizens want, not what the electors chose. When you choose by popular vote you also avoid many other things from occurring. For example, the electoral college is a method of selecting the president that may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. As explained in the text "" voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" Moreover, the electoral college is unfair to voters. candidates dont spend as time in states they know they have no chance of winning, and only focusing on the states that they do. As said in the text "" In a 2000 campaign , seventeen states dont see the candidates at all, including in rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. Making that hard for the people to see what there president wants to do for the country they have no idea because of the candidate too worried on winning and letting the citizens choose.

To elaborat on my claim, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The disaster factor is what happened in the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century , which allows the system for much worse. In the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors would effect the will of the citizens. sometimes ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever thet please."" Making another reason why the electoral college should'nt be here to stay.

Although, keeping the electoral college may not be a good thing to do.",0
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that ""we"" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be.",0
"Dear Senator, I respect and admire your position in office for you are always on your toes and doing work for your people. But one thing I do not admire as a citizen of the U.S., is the Electoral College in which our country goes by. When saying Electoral College I am meaning the process in which the election of the President by a vote is compromised with a popular vote of qualified citizens. By changing to a popular vote, everyone is equal and our location won't restrain us from our vote that we cast. The Electoral College may have suited our countries needs in the past but it is now time to abolish this unequal process.

To get things going, the Electoral College strays to many voters away. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", Plumer brought to my attention that many voters are aware that the candidate that they want to serve as president does not stand a chance in their state and because of this they do away with voting. Personally, I feel that voting should be something that everyone partakes in. After all, if you didn't vote you shouldn't complain. But in the boat we are in now, we US Citizens are being taken advantage of and are rights are simply stripped away in this form of voting. In fact, onehalf on eligible American voters did not vote in 2012 and I am sure the voting process we use has a strong influence on these people. If we were to vote, in some cases they won't even matter. This lets our location define us and not our beliefs.

This leads to the next point that it gives too much power to those we elected. Yes, we did elect them and we should have faith in them, but the Electoral College makes it very difficult to do. ""What Is the Electoral College?"" brought it to my attention that the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. So we simply place our votes in the hands of the minimal amount of people. I don't think so!

Lastly, did those serving in office think about the people at the bottom of the todem pole average US citizens rather than those at the top serving in office? ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" states ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Because of this, it becomes clear that my opinions and rights are stripped away. It completely disgusts me at the fact our nation is treating our citizens in this manner. It is time for those in office to think about who they are serving. Fiftyfive people shouldn't represent 500,000. We should all be able to cast votes equally with the same credentials.

All in all, there are in fact some limited benefits of an Electoral College, but a direct election or popular vote would suit our nation much better based on our needs in the present. Through Electoral College it is much easier to recognize who won the election and a few more advantages, but it has become very outdated and unequal.",0
"out with the old and in with the new. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" ""the indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" from Mother Jones by Bradford Plumer. The Electoral College needs to be replaced it has too much room for failure, manipulation,and its loose guidelines allow unfair representation.

The Electoral College has too much room for failure considering the only guidelines for electors are those that are not holding office and depending on the state electors are chosen in various ways. the guarantee that electors will vote in favor of majority vote of their state is not guaranteed. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprise...The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electorswhere they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress."" ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

The Electoral College allows room for manipulation and as cited in ""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" as ""the single best argument against the Electoral College"" would be the disaster factor described as the thing that the american people should consider themselves lucky didnt happen. The articles asks the reader to ""consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Citing an event in 1960 where louisiana attempted to replace electors with others that would vote in their favor and John Kennedy would not have won popular vote. In the event of a tie the election will be passed to the House of Representatives, because each state only gives one vote allowing states with meager population to have the same holding as states that represent millions upon millions and given the information that voters may vote one party to president and another for congress, the house's selection can hardly be reminiscent of the choices of the people that each one person represents.

The Electoral College is unfair because the candidatesknow which states will vote for them and which states definately wont and the ones that they might be able to find their way in favor. for example in ""the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong. jeopardising the validity of the entire capaign by putting the votes in the hands of swing voters to see who wins favor with visits to poor elementary schools and weak middle school student council campaigning by promising free ice cream and kissing babies.

The Electoral College needs to be thrown out there is no fixing what is already widely regarded as an anachronism.",0
"Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not surprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.

Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the ""easy"" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, troll's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, troll's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollution and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.

Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rushhour. This means less time spent with family anymore time bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoided all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appreciate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.

So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our environment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.",0
"When election day comes and you finally drop your vote in the ballet box after waiting in line for the past hour, you walk away knowing that you have helped the candidate of your choice to rise to the top of the voting pole. Oh how wrong you are. The United States works on a voting system called the Electoral College. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Plumer 10. This system has stood the test of time, however it has masked its flaws for long enough. ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Plumer 9. The people have spoken, now it is time to break down the logistics...

In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" Office of the Federal Register 2. This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, separated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born. The founding fathers reasons for forging this system where justified in their day and age. However the world has changed since then. These days education is standard and people have enough sense to know what each candidate has to offer, and who can guide our country to prosperity. If United States citizens are well educated, then why leave this barrier up?

Another large issue with the electoral college is its favoritism towards larger states. The United States was founded on federalism and democracy, giving power to the people instead of an overarching central government ruling everything. So any policy that goes against our right to equal say in politics ought to be abbolished, right? The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. ""... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators..."" Office of the Federal Register 3. Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Posner 21. This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom.

If the Electoral College does not seem like a flawed system now, allow me to open your eyes to one last variable in our little Electoral equation. The disaster factor. The disaster factor deals with the will of the people, and them doing anything to get what they want. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that the popular vote for Kennedy would not actually gone to Kennedy."" Plumer 11. That kind of scenario could completely change a close call to a landslide victory! The 1960 election is not the only case of this either. It happened again when Hawaii sent two slates of electors to congress, and in other various cases electors did not vote for their designated candidate. Finally there is the case of the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College! If just one person decides to go against the grain, everything gets thrown off.

Case and point, the Electoral College is a flawed system. People are educated and can make a smart choice for a president, everyone deserves fair say in the political world, and people need to open their eyes to the corruption that the Electoral College allows for. It may have made sense back in the day of the founding fathers, but it is time to move on and adopt the popular vote system that the people have asked for.",0
"There are many advantages today of limiting car usage. This accounts for car usage limits in Europe, United States, and many other places. Limiting car usage around the world isn't just good for society, but also for yourself. Limiting car usage helps to separate suburban life from over usage of autos. It's good for people to separate themselves from cars also because many people get stressed about their gas money, whether or not they will be late for something, and also because many people worry about their own driving, and may think they will injur somebody.

Reasons why limiting car usage has been discussed throughout many people and regions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. There has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities more suitable for walking but it's basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. From the passage, David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, says, ""All of our development since Wold War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Mr. Goldberg describes how everything pertaining to where places are built, how many roads built, and not enough sidewalks is because of the car being the center of everything, that people are not focusing on anything else.

Advantages of limiting car usage varies on different places. Some of these advantages include the ban of driving in Paris to help clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smug. In Bogota, Columbia the streets of this capital city, eerily devoid of traffic jams. Banning cars also cause less accidents around the world. Not using a car for one whole day limits stress on people and greatly lowers air pollution. Limiting the usage of cars in Bogota has also helped the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city.

Limiting car usage in many places even for one day has put a good effect on society, people, and the world. Limiting car usage in Germany suburbs opens the streets for tourists on troll's or just people who need to be to work on a certain time who cannot afford cars. It also reduces the air pollution by very much. From the passage Heidrun Walter said, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Opening the streets from cars allows isolation between suburban life and auto use. Greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by decline of car use which is good for the planet. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals due to their high usage of diesal gas. Causing the decline of car usage will remove smog due to not as much diesal going into the air. In Bogota the Day Without Cars is held to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota, Antanas Mockus, said, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" He also stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

In conclusion there's many ways to reduce air pollution. There's also many advantages to banning usage of cars. Not only are people stress free and feeling good, but airpollution decreases and Greenhouse gas emissions stop.",0
"The Electoral College was originally established as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Presidential candidate Al Gore actually won the popular vote done by citizens, but ended up losing the Electoral College voting which caused him to lose his campaign for presidency. To prevent further occurrences such as the fiasco involving Al Gore, the Electoral College must go. Former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter both happened to agree on the abolishment of the Electoral College! According to a gallop poll taken in the year 2000, over 60% of voters would prefer a more direct election process. In other words, they want the Electoral College system abolished.

Voters actually don't vote for President they vote for a slate of electors who end up voting for the president. I feel that this system isn't cohesive enough it's easy for people to think that a majority vote for a candidate means an automatic victory when actually the Electoral College votes are what truly matter. What would be the reaction if a certain member of the College decided to vote against his party's candidate? With a system filled to the brim with flaws, it's easy for many upsetting instances to occur in the future. In fact, the state of Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.

During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The Electoral College method is outdated, at best. If seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates, then something is obviously wrong. Had 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii voted the other way, a tie would've occurred in the 1976 presidential election.

There is one, gaping flaw in the Electoral College voting system the winnertakeall basis. A very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory! Another unfair aspect about the Electoral College is the fact that larger states garner more attention and votes! than do smaller ones. Florida netted candidate Obama 29 electoral votes whereas Wyoming snagged him 3 electoral votes. Such a discrepancy can turn off potential voters such as Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Overall, the Electoral College is an outdated practice which must be invalidated soon enough.",0
"Dear senator, I think that the presidential election should be settled by popular vote. We people are being run as a country by the president, and we should be able to have more of an impact choosing who our president will be.

The president currently gets chosen in the Electoral College, a process in which the electors vote for President and Vice President after they are selected. This process flows very well and the president is chosen easily, so its good. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. The majority being 270 electoral votes and the first president to get to this number in the race wins. We the people are separated into states and the states get however many electoral votes based on population. So the bigger states get more say on who's President, but I mean that makes sense because more citizens live there. There are also many flaws with this process though, and thats why I think it should be settled by popular vote.

You may think that the people are mainly voting for the President in the Electoral Collage process, but we're not. The people just vote for electors who in turn elect the President. Some of the slates of electors may even vote for who they want to and forget about what the majority of the state wants. At the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakesall system in each state. This means that if say Florida has twentynine electoral votes, then all twentynine go to the candidate who wins that state. ""So normaly candidates don't spend time in states they know they have know chance of winning, focusing only on the ""swing states"" and the larger populated states."" ""Swing states"" are states that pay close attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing candidates. This means that the states may pick the republican or democrat. Some states pick the same way every election. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. I mean what kind of madness is that, how are they supposed to know who to choose. Thats not fair and it shouldn't be settled that way. This all just proves that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Therefore the Electoral Collage shouldn't be the way to elect the President and VicePresident and should be either altered or in my opinion scratched. So then they should be elected by popular vote, so we have more control on who runs the country.",0
"The limiting of personalcar usage has done wonders for the areas that this policy has be implemented. Strictly enviermentaly speaking in the cites that have limited their residents personal car usage the smog rates went drasicly down. Thoughschanges happened in a matter of days. Imagin the changes that could accoure if limited car usage was implemented on a wider scale for the long term. Not only envirermentaly beneficial but limited car usage also has large and far reaching economic and social upsides. The lack of money being waisted on personal automobeal transportation leads to a surplus of savings for everyday familes to spend or more nessary items. Socialy limited car usage has be proven to be benifal as a whole also. People living in areas that have already been placed under this polices report significant reductions in stress and worrying, leading to much weight off their sholders and a general better aqttude over all.

The first and most obvious advantage of the limed car usage policiy is the massive positive impact the police has the earth. As stated in source one and I quote ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."". Now imagin if thoes percentages just went away. In the city of Vauban Germany, an experimental city already under the policy, it did. Another example if Paris. A city that literly had to force the policy of limited car usage apon it people in a desperate attempt to reverse what the evils of personal car usage was doing to the atmosphere of the city. The personal cars created smog so think the city hit record pollution levels that even rivaled Beijing its self, one of the worlds most poluted citys. As stated in source two, the city put a ban on cars with any license plates that were even numbered on the first day from driving and a ban on odd numbered the second day. The positives of the limited car usage plicy was so instantaneous that the second day of no driving for odd numbered cars was deamed not nessary. The massive environmental advantages of the limited car usage policiy can neiter be denyed or ignored.

The economic advantages of this policy can also not be ignored. To fully grasp the economic upswing that will accure under this policy we must turn our attention the the great city of Bogota, Colombia. In this former Spanish colony turned capital city a program has been set up called the ""carfree day"". On this day no cars are driven and a festable is set up to promote alternate transportaion and reduce smog. This year two other Colombian citys, Cali and Valledupar joned the event citing the obouse advantages of the policy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza source 3 quotes. The policy as done economic wonders not only for the people but for the city its self. since the day begin in the mid 1990s over 118 miles of bike path have been created, parksand sports centers have bloomed throughout the city, uneven sidke walks have been leveled out, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up as reported by source 3. The limited car usage policy cound be the merical policy for citys in need of an economic boost.

Finaly the social advantages of the policy have also been noted.

The evils of the modern day car culture must be destroyed. As said by Carlos Plaza preveously ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". ""When i had a car I was always tense. Im mush happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter resident of Vauban. Two people on two totaly differnt sides of the world both experenced the social advantages of this policy. Even young people are seeing the advantages according to a study last year that found that driving by young people devreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 according to source 4.

As one can now clearly see the advantages of limted personal car usage are impossibkle to deny and even harder to ignore. Economicly,socialy, and enviromentaly this policy as done wonders where ever it has been implimented. It has both immeadit and long term positive effects with no odveous negitive effects. Altrnates to personal cars could be things like Bill fords bisiness plan for a world in which personal vehical ownership is replaced witha partnering with the telecommunications industy to create citys in which pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, and public and commerical traffic are woven into a connected netword. The acceptence of limited car usage and the extenciton of modern day car culture is the next step for the advacment of humanity.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage is incredible because we can actually just get out of the house and hang out with friends and family. Also people could get some exercise at that by walking to work or school or wherever you are going to and the percentage of people with obesity would most likey drop down excessively by just doing this.

You also might actually have a happier life by giving up automobiles for example what this person Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This evolution of limiting car usage is very beneficial especially for the environment by decreasing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and all of the bad gasses going into the air by all these automobiles and just maybe get or climate and everything back together they way it should be.

In this new approach, to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. Stores are placed just a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways where you need a car to get there.

By doing things like this especially in America would be big in safety because you would have to worry as much about your children being hit or ran over by cars or being kidnapped to because you can only walk or ride bikes, taxis and public buses.

Therefore you can also take time and actually look where you are and where you live and take it all in instead of panicking and being all tense and stressed on having to rush or go somewhere and just being in a calm, peaceful and quiet location. Like in what thisperson Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman said "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" as he rode on a twoseat bicycle with his wife.

By doing this it would also decrease the amount of congestion in different cities across the globe.

In my opinion, I'd love to try in do this because we would not be on our phones going strait to our cars instead we would be walking or riding our bike or get on a public bus and actually see and meet people instead of just waiting in the traffic and waiting to just go and do whatever we want to and the Internet is a big deal in this to. A sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center cities various factors like: the Internet makes telecommutung possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to goo and meet up with friends. The rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has faciliated more flexible commuting arrangments, including the evolution of shared van services from getting to work.",0
"The electoral college is a group of electors that vote for the president and vicepresident. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What Is The Electoral College, 1 They consist of 538 electors and you need a majority of 270 in order to be elected. They are wrong because they take the majority vote from the state's population and turn it into electoral votes which is a ""winnertakeall"" system, and they can be anyone not holding public office which can bring opinions into play, such as segregation.

The first and most important reason the electoral college is wrong is because they are based off of majority vote. This is bad because people who voted for the other party don't even get counted in the electoral votes. For instance, if there is a population of 1,000,000 people in a state and 600,000 of the people vote for one party, the majority goes to that party, but what about the other 400,000 people that voted for their party. And don't forget the 2000 election between Gore and Bush. Al Gore had the popular vote, yet lost the presidency. How does this make any sense? This leads to my final reasoning of why the electoral college is wrong...

The electoral college is wrong because the electors can be anyone not holding public office. Anyone not in public office could be basically anyone, even you or me. This can cause problems such as opinion, racism, etc. They could want somebody to become president because of their skin color or their political party. For example, ""in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, 11 What if this happens again? We could have a president that nobody even elected for as president and our government could drastically change.

Even though the electoral college is wrong, there is one good thing about it. This is because the ""certainty of outcome"" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, 15. Which mean that usually the electoral votes and the popular votes usually coincide with each other, where both are for the same person. For instance, ""in 2012's election Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and 51.3 percent of the popular vote"" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, 15. So this mean that for both electoral and popular he had the majority of the votes.

All in all, I agree with ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO"" with ""abolishing the electoral college!"" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, 15. Especially with the ""winnertakeall"" point of it. I think that the population should choose the president off of their opinions instead of being forgotten if their not in the majority vote. Everyone's vote should count. This would be a lot more fair to everyone.",0
"From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the environment and the people living there. The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage?

Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the environment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how nearrecord pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capital lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year called The Day Without Cars, but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smooth sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Both of these articles explain how limiting car usage in a city can be beneficial to both the city and its residents.

In addition, the United States in partaking in this quest for less cars as well. Article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal shows us that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" It is possible that this is partially because of the recession many Americans could not afford cars. Also, more center cities have made the ""suburbs less appealing and has drawn the empty nesters back in"". If this goes on, scientists believe carbon emissions could greatly reduce and this will be extremely beneficial for the environment. According to the Mr. Sivak's research, less and less people between the age of 1639 have been getting licenses. More studies have concluded the same results, but only time will tell in this trend will continue. No matter the reason behind it, this example also demonstrates how limited car usage is beneficial.

On the other hand, some believe that less cars is NOT beneficial. In source four, it claims that the lowered amount of people driving automobiles will be harmful to the profits of the car industry. To further explain, ""companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"". This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite beneficial.

Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and environment, can be both beneficial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the environment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.",0
"An electoral College compromises between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

This presidential election is held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday in November. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors andare chosen by the candidates political part.

Personally Ibelieve that the presidential election should be based on popular votebecause as citizens of the United States we should be able to help the output of what our futures will look like and be able to choose who we want to lead us. Whichever candidate gets the most votes wins and they become the new president of the United States. Not that Electoral college is all bad its just when you vote you vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president of their choice.

Citizens would be more likely to vote for their present if they felt like their vote would actually matter and have an effect on who the future president will be. People are less likely to participate or care if they feel like their vote doesn matter and is taken up and not counted. If people knew that it was over popular vote that will decide the future president then they're going to vote more and be more active when stuff like this takes place because they feel like their vote actually matters and is making a difference.

Electoral College is unfair to voters because ""winnertakeall system"" in each state.

Candidates dont spend much time trying to win the votes of a state they think isnt going to help them in the long run by winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. This included Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt see a single campaign ad. Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

Bob Dole once said ""electoral college should be abolished"" and from the looks of it he's notwrong. Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFLCIO arestanding with Dole on this accusation andbothagree on aboloishing this act. A Gallup poll was taken in 2000 and won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer direct election over the kind we have now which is Electoral College.",0
"Cars have become a part of everyday life over the years. We depend on them for transportation from one place to the next. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live without a car? Well, globally, changes are being made. There have been car bans and even a community that completely quit using cars. There are advantages of limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage can lead to a less stressful life. The residents of Vauban, Germany, have taken a huge step. They have given up their cars. As stated in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"",70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars. A statement from a local resident, also found in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". The limit on car usage has allowed the residents to go back to a simpler life. A life where everyday noises such as children playing and bicycle wheels rollingalong the pavement can be heard.

Limiting car usage impacts the environment greatly in a positive way. The article titled ""The End of Car Culture"" states, ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"".Cars are a leading cause of air pollution around the world. For example, the smog in Paris, France, had gotten so bad that they had to put a temporary partial ban on driving. Due to this rule, congestion was down 60 percent. Cutting back on the usage of cars would have an incredible impact on global air pollution. A simple step in the right direction can change the environment is a positive way.

Being happier and decreasing air pollution are only two advantages of limiting car usage. There is a lot that can come from taking cars out of our daily routines. It may be hard to adjust at first but the impact it would have on the earth would be worth it. Taking responsibility and care of our earth is a change that needs to happen. Itis a possible and reasonable solution to our pollution problem.",0
"These sources focus on the advantages of limiting car usage. The usage of cars has been decreasing as the years go by, not only in the United States, but in other countries as well. The residents of certain countries are beginning to use walking or taking a train or a city bus as a means of transportation instead of using their cars, that is if they own one.

The advantages of limiting car usage are endless. One advantage is that it relieves a big amount of stress on people. According to source one, having a car is a big responsibility, sometimes one that certain people are not able to handle. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Not having a car or avoiding having to use a car is becoming easier for people. For people that live in suburban areas, public transportation is going to have a higher demand. This is because there is an attempt to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are going to be placed a walk away, or on a main street, rather than having them all together in malls along a distant highway. Not only will it make it easier for people to access stores or other necessities, but the money that the public transportation will receive will go to the city, giving them more to use on important things the community needs. Furthermore, it is evident that limiting car usage relieves a big amount of stress on people.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it brings people and countries together for a cause. Limiting the use of cars is spreading worldwide and there are many people that agree with this concept. According to the third source, in Bogota, Colombia, a program has been started that is set to lower the rate of care usage and increase the usage of public transportation. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day, leaving the streets of this capital city empty and unoccupied. The interactions between the community are inevitable with so much people walking and being all in one place at one time. Furthermore, the act of a carfree day is also spreading to other countries. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were extremely enthusiastic. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique rivera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay. With this act spreading and moving across borders into other countries, the use of cars will soon begin to decrease even more than it already has. This will help to lower the pollution as well as other economic problems caused by cars.

These sources focus on the advantages of limiting car usage. The usage of cars has been decreasing as the years go by, not only in the United States, but in other countries as well. The residents of certain countries are beginning to use walking or taking a train or a city bus as a means of transportation instead of using their cars, that is if they own one.",0
"Cars are a very big part of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.",0
"Since World War II we have been heavily dependent on the modern day transportation: the car. Some say the car is an innovative and convenient method of transportation, while others say that it will be the end of the environment. As the evidence indicates, there are advantages to limiting car usage.

Dissenters of the idea claim to say that limiting car usage will negatively impact the car industry, but it doesn't. Limiting car usage doesn't mean that people will have to stop buying cars it simply means that they will have to find a different method of transportation. Source 2 says that in Paris on certain days motorist, who had an odd or even license plate number, had to leave their cars at home and find an alternative method of transportation. Does the evidence demonstrate an impact to car companies? Did they have a financial deficit due to their lack of buyers? The answer is simple: no, because they didn't ban the use of cars. Also, car companies can well benefit from places that limit car usage but allow hybrid cars this allows for an increase in revenue. Most car companies in today's society model hybrid cars that run on primarily electricity and gas. In Paris, they made exceptions ""for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers Source 2"". These exceptions actually promote the buying of hybrid cars! This will boost the economic profit of the car companies, not damage it. Limiting car usage does not affect car companies, but instead supports it.

The limitation of car usage betters the environment. Cars emit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere faster than they can be removed. This causes health problems in living organisms and pollution of ecosystems. Cars are liable for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in areas in the U.S. as Source 1 states. People are playing with the balance of nature and if its not fixed then humans are as good as dead this is why the implementation of limiting car usage benefits people. The effects of this can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, whose goal is to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation Source 3, and Paris, where intense smog covered the enitre city: ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.Source 2"" The source explains that cold nights and warm days trapped in car emissions and after a few days of reducing car usage the air cleared up. This shows the effectiveness of the limiations of car usage.

The limiting of cars also boosts community wellness. The people who experienced this regulation had positive views on the matter and even on rainy days they participated! Bogota, Colombia has gone into its third year of banning cars and the turnouts of the pariticipation were large, with two other Colombian cities joining and municipal authorities from other countries to view the event Source 3. The evidence show that limiting cars wasn't opposed by the people, in fact, other countries were wanting to get in on the action. This limiting of car usage really cuts down on traffic congestion and new community projects have been established to ease the transition to alternative transportation. Heidrun Walter, mentioned in Source 1, syas that when she had her car she always tense and stressed and is happy with the change. The source also mentions that the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor Source 1."" This shows that the limitation of car usage greatly enchances the wellness of the community and promotes a safe and stressfree environment for the people.

In summation, the limitation of car usage doesn't negatively impact car companies, but instead increases hybrid car sale revenue, echances community wellness, betters the environment. The things that can be accomplished with this regulation only has benefits for everyone.",0
"Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states,"" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters."" Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars."" Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.",0
"studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France banned Driving do to smog. Sounds extreme, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely "" CarFree "". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an additional 40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of vaughn's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA is promoting "" "" communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a carfree day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they banned driveing all togather. France decided that they where going to order evennumbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. Same for oddnumbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and carfree campaigns have helped our environment. These countries have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to participate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of carfree suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.",0
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we ""abolish"" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter.",0
"Limiting car usage has many advantages. Such as putting a lot less pollution in the air and having your stress level go down letting you spend time with your family and friends. When we put pollution in the air it ruins our beautiful ecosystem. When driving a car you have to stress about how much gas you have or you stress about if you are going over the speed limit.

The first advantage to not having cars is we limit the amount of pollution in the air. Did you know that in Europe you cause up to twelve percent of its greenhouse gas, and in the US you cause up to fifty percent of that gas, that just goes in the air causing the air that we breath to become polluted. Some ways to prevent this is to carpool with someone or just to walk there and not drive, you get to help the environment and you get your daily workout as well. Some countries have taking the role of taxing anyone who wants to use a car. Like in France, who has a tax policy that makes people choose diesel instead of regular gasoline. France has over sixtyseven percent of cars that run on diesel fuel. Paris has banned the use of cars do to the huge amount of smog they are having.

The second advantage for limiting the usage of cars is lowering your stress level and being able to spend time with family and friends. To help with this some countries have programs that provide people with bikes and other forms of transportation in order for people to get to work. When people don't drive cars and walk with their kids to drop them off at school then go to work it keeps the traffic and all the stress that comes with it down to an all time low. When summer time comes around teens can organize what they do and who they hang out with based on where they are and how far they want to walk to get there.

So limiting the usage of cars has many significant advantages like less pollution and being able to spend time with family and friends while lowering your stress level. So before you get in your car and drive to wherever you are going just take a second and think, can I walk there instead.",0
"There's a new trend that has been developing for years now, and soon will be in full throttle affect. The mass amount of pollution being produced worldwide over the years has been at terrifying levels, up until the last five to ten years. Although not the first cause of the pollution, gases emitted from transportation is the second largest contributed to this ""green house gas"" issue going on, according to source 4. An idea to hinder this growing issue and potentially put the pollution levels at a decline is the effort to limit personal car usage. By doing this, we inhabitants of the world are able to help clear the air, reduce congestion on the streets, and live a simpler, more cost efficient lifestyle.

Polution, as we know, is an ongoing trend that is proving lethal to our environment. Factories and power plants are the number one cause of pollution in the world. This is almost inevitable, since we have yet to develop a way to produce in mass amounts in a clean way. However, what we can have a part in is limiting the personal car usage to promote cleaner air. Public transportation, carpooling, and hybridelectric cars have been seen as the alternative to owning personal cars. Those options are also seen as the solution, considering their contribution to the act since ""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak of 2005"" source 4. Reducing the amout of miles driven links to the amout of dangerous gases emitted into the air, therefor ""having cleaner air."" Rush hour traffic is obnoxious and is the least fun part of driving. Encouraging people to drive less and either walk, bike, or use public transportation will help end the long waits sitting bumpertobumper on the roads. In France, a study was done where fines were placed on people who drove by themselves or with only one passenger excluding hybrids and ""plug in"" cars. According to the source, ""congestion was down 60 percent."" Just a week of not driving with personal gasoline or diesel cars proved to be extremely beneficial in clearing out the streets, making for easier courses to work. The concept is truly simple. We use less cars, there's less people on the street, and you can get to and fro much faster and without hassle. Reducing the number of cars on the street is also a goodway to inspire motor companies to be inventive. Losing business will ultimately result in extermination of the business, unless the corporation is able to come up with new products to satisfy the consumer. Mitsubishi is a automotive company that also makes air conditioners. According to source 4, Ford and Mercedes are ""rebranding"" themselves to comply with the new trend.

Almost everyone wants to live a clean, healthy and simple lifestyle and participation in limiting the number of cars driven daily is a very easy way to do so. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" source 1. This refers to the successful suburban trial in Vauban, Germany to no longer own cars. Parking on the street, personal garages, and driveways in general are seen as taboo in the living district near France and Switzerland's border source 1. Very few people own cars, let alone drive them. Not only does lowering the usage of cars help the environment and make the journey to wherever you're going much less complicated, it also initiates the restoration of things considered not as important such as sidewalks, parks, and public transport systems. The more people using the utilities, the more cities will fund them and make the experience more enjoyable. In Bogata, the ""day without cars"" campaign has led to 118 miles of bycle paths being constructed source 3. The chain of events will lead to more and more people utilizing their bikes and feet to get around, instead of cars.

Driving used to be considered the most popular way to get around town from point A to point B and back. But now, with a push to limit personal car usage, a positive switch is happening to where more and more people are no longer relying on their vehicles to move aboutinstead bikes, subways and buses, and even just our own two feet are our means of transportation. This ""smart planning"" reduces green house gases along with traffic congestion, and also promotes a simpler, healthier lifestyle.",0
"As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?

We we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.According to ""In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal. In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that evennumbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.

You might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way"". According to ""Carfree dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution"".

According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.

So I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.",0
"Cars have been around since the 1800's and have been popular ever since. Although, in recent years the number of cars bought and licenses attained have been dropping. Car usage has also dropped, which is a good thing. Because of limited car usage, people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves.

Cars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.

""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, less people drive, which in turn limits pollution. ""... but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" Again we see that cars are polluting our world, and it's caused by us. "" it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage clears up the pollution which helps us and the environment stay healthy.

Many people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. All of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" It is better to limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment, but you're also saving money and helping yourself out. Due to the lower amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.' "" The way people live will benefit from lower car usage. Our lifes will be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the long run it benefits all of the community.

As bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to walk or take the bus instead, limted car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and will help our environment in the long run. Limited car usage is truely a good thing for us and will hopefully continue.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for individuals and the community as a whole. The passage set provides evidence of this trend happening in different parts of the world, including Germany, France, and Colombia. In these places, efforts have been made to reduce the dependence on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage can lead to a cleaner environment, healthier individuals, and better community planning.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution being released into the environment. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where air pollution can have severe health consequences for residents.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on individual health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, mentions that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on that particular day. Engaging in physical activity like walking or cycling instead of driving can help improve cardiovascular health and overall fitness. It can also reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to better community planning and more efficient land use. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes a community where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. Instead, emphasis is placed on public transportation and walking. This approach makes it easier for people to access amenities and services on foot and reduces the need for large parking lots and sprawling developments. Compact and walkable communities can promote social interaction, reduce traffic congestion, and improve quality of life.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have a range of advantages for both individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote physical activity and better health, and lead to more efficient community planning. As the passages suggest, these efforts are already being implemented in different parts of the world. It is important for individuals to consider alternative modes of transportation and make choices that contribute to a cleaner and healthier future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, reduce traffic congestion, and create more vibrant and walkable neighborhoods. These benefits have been observed in various places around the world where car usage has been limited.

One example is Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars.

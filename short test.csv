"The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural occurrence. On Mars, there are things called a battle or mesa. Which in fact, is what this ""face"" really is. I know this because in the article, that was based off NASA's own research, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a battle or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" We have these landforms on our very own planet, so its understandable as to how we can recognize one on another planet.

On top of that, we used top quality equipment to study and research the Face on Mars. This is backed up by how in the article it says, ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,' said Gavin. 'Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo.""

In the article itself it even says that the face is no alien monument. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" With all that being said, with all the proof NASA gathered, it's impossible for the ""Face on Mars"" to be anything but a natural occurrence.",0
"Students have a higher chance of catching a virus during school hours. Viruses could easily spread to others by touching or any other types of physical interactions. It's not easy to cure a virus and some viruses could be deadly, like the Coronavirus. A lot of people, mostly students in Wuhan, China are getting this virus and most of them claim it spread through physical interaction. The virus is spreading quickly, and now we have many cases and few deaths in the U.S. Even though it is very important to be interacting with other students when you are in school, a single touch could possibly harm you. Some people believe that distance learning is not beneficial since students need to interact with others; However, being able to attend classes from home is a huge advantage and a good way for students to avoid catching any type of virus.

Many schools offer distance learning only for students who need it. Some schools offer it as an option for students who want to attend classes from home. Students can easily attend school classes either online or by video conferencing. One of the advantages of distance learning is that, students are not going to wait on their buses early in the morning when its cold, foggy, and rainy. Instead, they will be sitting at home feeling cozy and safe while doing their school work. However, in winter, when students enter the school building it's usually very warm and when they leave it's freezing outside, so they end up catching a cold. That leads to parents having to spend money and take their children to the hospital. In the hospital there are many sick people around, so students could catch viruses easily. Distance learning could also help parents save up money and not having to worry about taking their kids to the hospital because students are less likely to get sick and catch a cold when they are at home.

Since the Coronavirus is made out of many viruses and germs joined together, being outside when its cold or being around many students could be dangerous. One way for students to prevent themselves from catching this virus is by washing their hands all the time. Because this virus could also spread through droplets when coughing or sneezing. Students always forget to wash their hands after they cough and when they touch other students they spread germs. Parents, however, are always reminding their children to wash their hands before doing anything. When students attend classes from home they are spending more time with their parents. Therefore, students will always be reminded to wash their hands. That way they will be safe and prevented from catching or spreading any germs.

In conclusion, distance learning or attending classes from home is a beneficial advantage for students to look forward into. It's not only a good way to protect students from catching or spreading deadly viruses, It will also help parents spend less money when it comes to hospital bills and school supplies such as backpacks and books. Also, Students are going to be around their family and pets which means they are going to feel more happy doing their school work. They are not going to sit around watching the clock waiting to go home because they are going to be already home. By staying home and attending classes at home, students aren't going to be catching diseases and then spreading to other people. Clearly, they aren't going to be harmed or harm people. Distance learning is the best start that that will take us to the solution to those deadly problems.",0
"Driverless cars have good and bad things that would go along with them. From my perspective though I believe that we could go without them. Cars that can drive themselves not only puts the one driving in danger but anyone around the car. Having driverless cars just makes us lazy, if we can not drive a car. Driverless cars should not be something we should invest our money into.

Cars that can drive themselves is a very dangerous and scary idea. A big machine that is operating itself around others that are doing the exact thing is not a good idea. Very many mechanical mishaps could happen easily to cause the car to do things it wasn't made to do. If an animal or a person would happen to jump in the street would the car be able to detect that and stop the car before something very bad was to happen?

Having driverless cars puts a bad message on us. Having driverless cars would mean we don't want to drive or are too tried to drive or just to lazy. I think that this would make the United States look bad if we were to happen to get driverless cars.

Driverless cars may save us money individual but over all as a country I think we could lose money. Driverless cars have so many sensors and devices that would need to be installed and would have to be manufactured which causes a lot of money. ""These smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This was stated to show that these sensors and things that are needed to manufacture these cars are more expensive than they should be. This is why I think driverless cars are a bad idea.",0
"Some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way. Others might say that it is not.

I agree with this statement. If you are traveling by yourself, you might want to consider traveling with a guide who is experienced in the area you plan to visit. A good guide can help you make the most of your trip.

"How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.

In the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an huge interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyway, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.

With the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many opportunities that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremely helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievement for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside the school as well.

In the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activities that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.

In conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activities may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",0
"In the past few years, cellphones have become a major use of communication for many people. Cellphone has become a major issue in the field of driving. Many people drive while they're on the cellphone. The use of cellphones while driving should be banned. I say this because there have been 60-70% of drivers that have died, crashed due to the fact that they are using their cellphones while driving.

To begin with, the use of cellphones while driving should be stopped. In the last few years there have been many car crashes because people are all into their phones when they overall focus should be driving. At times cellphones can be of good use. But not all the time. People use cellphones to help them get to and from, but they shouldn't be used all the time.

According to the law of Tennessee, ""banning hand-held cellphone use while driving takes effect July 1"". ""Beginning July 1, the drivers could face a major fine up to $200 for using their cellphones while driving"". This should be banned in the state of Georgia, because the drivers don't realize how much damage they're causing when they are on their cellphones.

In conclusion, cellphones should be banned. They should not be used while driving. If people want to avoid getting into accidents they should stop using their phones while driving. If there weren't any accidents the world would be a safer place. Having cellphones can be of good use as well. But only if people use them that way. Making a phone call while driving can be dangerous as well. Making phone calls aren't always that important. So banning cellphones while driving could result in a better solution.",0
"Cell phones have become an essential tool for communication in our daily lives. However, when it comes to using them while driving, it's a topic of much debate. Some people argue that drivers should be able to use their cell phones in certain circumstances, while others believe that it's too risky and could lead to accidents. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. When we are behind the wheel, our focus should be on the road and the other cars around us. If we are busy texting, calling, or browsing social media, we are taking our eyes off the road and our hands off the wheel. This increases the chances of getting into an accident, which could not only harm us but also other innocent people. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. This is a staggering number and proves that distracted driving is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs our reaction time. When we are driving, we need to be able to react quickly to unexpected situations. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly steps into the road, we need to be able to hit the brakes immediately. However, if we are busy with our cell phone, we might not be able to react as quickly, which could result in a tragic accident. Our reaction time is critical when it comes to driving, and using a cell phone compromises that.

Thirdly, there are many other ways to communicate while driving that are safer than using a cell phone. For example, we can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, to take calls and communicate with others. We can also use voice-to-text features to send messages or make calls without having to physically handle our phones. These alternatives allow us to communicate safely while still keeping our eyes on the road and our hands on the wheel.

Lastly, setting a good example is important. As drivers, we have a responsibility to set a good example for other drivers and pedestrians. If we use our cell phones while driving, we are sending a message that it's okay to do so, which could encourage other drivers to do the same. This could lead to a culture of distracted driving, which would be detrimental to road safety.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is a risky behavior that can lead to accidents and fatalities. It's important that we prioritize road safety and avoid distractions while driving. There are safer alternatives available, such as hands-free devices and voice-to-text features, which allow us to communicate without compromising our safety. As drivers, we have a responsibility to set a good example and promote safe driving practices. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",1
"Hey there!  So, you know, making decisions in life can be super tough. Like, there are so many things to consider, and it's hard to know what's best. But, I think it's really important to listen to both your heart and mind when making choices.

Like, your heart can tell you what you really want and what makes you happy, but your mind can help you figure out how to make it happen. It's like, they're both trying to tell you what to do, but in different ways. And, you know, it's important to listen to both of them because they're both important.

But, sometimes, people can be really negative and try to bring you down. They might be like, ""Oh, you're never going to make it."" Or, ""That's not going to work."" And, it's easy to get caught up in that and start feeling like you can't do things. But, you have to ignore that stuff. Like, you have to have faith in yourself and your ideas, even if other people don't.

So, how do you stay motivated and ignore the negativity? Well, I think it's important to set goals for yourself and work towards them. Like, if you want to start a business, you have to start taking steps towards making it happen. And, you have to be willing to learn and take risks. It's not going to be easy, but it'll be worth it in the end.

And, it's also important to surround yourself with people who support you and believe in you. Like, if you're trying to start a band, you want people who are going to be like, ""Yeah, you can do it!"" And, not try to bring you down.

So, in conclusion, listening to your heart and mind when making decisions and staying motivated to achieve success can be really hard, but it's important to do it. You have to ignore the negativity and keep going. And, it's okay to ask for help and support along the way. Thanks for reading!",1
"In my op pinon school is good how it is now. Having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break. For example if I were to leave school for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a difference. And I'm a sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. A year-around school benefits teachers not students. Because they if they did have a year-around teachers wouldn't have to worry about reteaching it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. So they should have a regular schedule for the schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. When their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that, but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the students as much. If they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students, and they only have a certain amount of time to get things done within the time period, and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldn't get everything done in time then the whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go through tall that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students don't stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain about of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks in between school days just so that they have months off on their summer break.",0
"Researching the pros and cons of accelerated high school experiences has become increasingly relevant for today’s teens. Students who have accelerated their high school experience and succeeded, and those who have failed, have provided valuable case studies and insights into the challenges armed, and unprepared students can face. 

Successful students have often cited the acceleration of their high school experience as providing them with an opportunity to get ahead in college before their peers. For instance, students who graduate early may be able to begin college with a major or focus on a field of study before other students who are just entering college. On the other hand however, unprepared and ill-advised students who have accelerated their high school experience have found themselves facing difficulties, such as ill-preparedness for college level classes, struggling to make friends, and missing out on high school experiences and events.

It is important to consider these implications for the future of education, and ensure that adolescents are properly informed and advised when considering accelerating their high school experience. With the right knowledge, support, and preparation, these students can tap into the opportunities that accelerated high school can provide, while avoiding the pitfalls of inexperience and insufficient preparation.",1
"Why should anyone want to have a car drive you anywhere you want to go when you can drive yourself? You should be the one in control of the car not the other way around, there could be a malfunction with the car that might cause a break, and they don't need more technology to a car, because at the end of the day you're not going to have it all of your life. I'm against having the Google car, because who needs a literally has laser beams that comes out of the top of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

You should be the one in control of the car at all times. A person learns how to drive for a reason. They learn how to drive, so that their parents don't have to anymore, to maybe go places by yourself, and just to see how well you have learned to drive and how much you have improved before you started to drive in the first place. Having a human drive you are better than a robot driving you because you have an advantage of learning and continuing how to learn how.

Having malfunctions is a big problem. There is a lot that can happen to you if you manage to mess something up or if you just crash and wreak your car. You can push a button that can do some serious harm to you or anyone that is in the car at the time, you can break some bones by cracking into another car or a tree, and it can make you have some type of brain damage. Having malfunctions are bad, but dying in the process of your vehicle having a malfunction is horrible.

You're not always going to have that car all of you life. You might sell it, pass it down to one of your kids, or just leave it on the side of the road. I don't know what you would do with it. Not everybody has had a car the have had all of their life that would be a big problem in having it all your life. Having a Google car isn't always going to be there.

I will not agree for having a Google car, but if I did, i couldn't possibly let it drive for me. I would be the one to drive it at all times.",0
"Driverless cars may seem like a cool new innovation that take the stress away from driving. The truth is that while there are many positive things about driverless cars there are still many complications with introducing them into society. Without a driver, the mechanics could malfunction and cause a safety threat to other drivers and pedestrians. Many states also have laws against even testing driverless cars. Even thought the car can do the basic driving by itself, the human passengers still need to take control for more complicated road conditions. The production and use of driverless cars is negative to society because they pose a safety threat, force laws to change, and they still require human control.

Safety is always a concern when dealing with any type of motor vehicle and driverless cars increase the risk of safety because they do not have human control. Every state has road laws that every driver is meant to follow. Traffic laws assume that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence states how the laws believe that a car is only safe when there is a human controlling it. These laws are meant to promote safety and since they state a human needs to be in control for a vehicle to be safe, then driverless cars are not the best thing for safety. This is negative because when there is a larger safety risk, more people may be fatally injured and the public will feel unsafe. The use of driverless cars on the road would require the laws to be modified and allow their use.

Another way that driverless cars are negative to society is that they would force the laws to change to accommodate them. All over the country there are laws in place that prohibit the use of driverless cars. According to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"". Since driverless cars are illegal in most states, in order for them to be used on the roads all the laws relevant to this topic would need to be changed or adjusted. Changing the laws is negative because changing the already safe laws could cause the public to be unsafe and the process for changing the laws is a castle. It needs to be sent in and approved by many government branches and could be rejected by anyone, causing the process to repeat. Not only is it a castle and burden, it is also taking a lot of time. Even if the laws are changed the cars still require human involvement

Driverless cars may seem more convenient but in reality they require human interaction in any tough traffic situation. As a result this is negative because it is not improving the convenience for drivers. Some say that driverless cars are more convenient, but in fact they can only perform the easy aspects of driving without the aid from the human driver. Driverless cars ""can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires human skills""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence shows how involved humans have to be in a ""driverless"" car. An invention that seems convenient actually requires the driver to be more alert, so they know when they need to step in to control the car in difficult situations. This is negative because waiting for difficult road conditions can cause a driver to be more stressed and anxious than they would be if they were normally driving a car. Since the driver needs to more alert and the fact that driverless cars are not that convenient at all there is no reason for them to be on the roads.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be produced and driven on the roads because they pose a safely threat to the public, they require the laws to change, and they still need human interaction and therefore are not a convenience. Considering this, is it really worth all the risk and castle just for something ""cool"" to be on the road? Would it still be cool if these vehicles endangered you or a family member?",0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It is time for us to elect our president by popular vote.

There are many reasons why the Electoral College is a flawed system. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. In a state like Wyoming, for example, a single vote is worth three times as much as a vote in California. This is because each state has two senators, regardless of population, and each state has a number of electors equal to the number of its representatives in Congress plus its two senators. This means that a voter in Wyoming has 3.7 times as much power as a voter in California in choosing the president.

Second, the Electoral College can lead to results that do not reflect the will of the people. In 2000, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election to George W. Bush. This was because Bush won more electoral votes, even though Gore won more votes nationwide. This has happened four other times in our history, and it is a clear sign that the Electoral College is not a fair system.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of ""battleground"" states. These are states where the outcome of the election is uncertain, and they are the only states where candidates spend any time campaigning. This means that voters in other states are essentially ignored by the candidates, which is not fair to them.

Finally, the Electoral College is a relic of a bygone era. It was created in a time when the United States was a very different country. The Founding Fathers were worried that a popular vote for president would give too much power to the large states, so they created the Electoral College as a way to protect the interests of the small states. However, this is no longer a valid concern. The United States is now a much more populous country, and the small states are no longer at a disadvantage.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It is time for us to elect our president by popular vote. This would be a fair and just system that would give all voters a voice.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"When electing the President of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolux College to decide. The Electoral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. Many people dislike this system including myself. I disprove of this system because it limits representation, permits the disinterest of voters, and reduces a candidates interest in a state.

One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. The Electoral College votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states receives. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only receives one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for Wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have accurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. There have also been times in which a president has won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote.

One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait.

As stated before, the larger the population of a state, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. In many states throughout an election period (the period in which candidates move to different states giving speeches) the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president.

The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. Moving to popular vote will fix all of these problems and will improve the way we vote for our president.",0
"Completing high school one year early can seem like a great opportunity for students to start their careers and gain experience. However, it is important to consider the benefits of completing the traditional four years of high school before moving on to college. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why it is better to finish high school in the traditional manner.

Firstly, completing the four years of high school allows students to prepare more for college. This time can be used to reflect on one's interests and career goals, and to take the necessary steps to achieve them. For example, the four years of high school helped me to discover my passion for a particular field and to work towards it. It also helped me to become more mature and prepared for the next step.

Secondly, it is too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17. At this age, students may not be fully ready to take on the responsibilities of college life. They may not have had enough time to mature and develop the skills necessary to succeed in college. For example, my younger brother is 16 and is currently a junior in high school. When we have nothing to do or are having a conversation, I always ask him if he is ready to go to college, and his response is that he is not even ready for his senior year. I understand his perspective, as I was his age when I was a junior.

Finally, students may not have had enough education to succeed in college. Completing four years of high school allows students to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in college. If students graduate early, they may be at a disadvantage in college, as they may not have had enough time to fully understand the material. For example, I have heard from some friends in college that they struggled in certain classes, even though they graduated from high school at 18. This suggests that if students graduate early, they may not have had enough time to fully understand the material.

In conclusion, completing high school in the traditional manner has many benefits. It allows students to prepare more for college, it is not too early for students to finish high school, and it allows students to gain the necessary education to succeed in college. High school is a crucial step in one's life, and completing it in the traditional manner can set the stage for success in the future.",1
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers. The author has a few reasons of why he thinks this. Some of them are to find out what it is made up of. Another one is to try and find out why there is no life on Mars. Also even though he thinks they should explore it he talks about the dangers and how really dangerous it is. There are a lot of risks to exploring Venus, but it would be worth it.

One thing that the author does well to support his idea is he gives a lot of compelling reasons of why he this Venus is worth exploring. One of the reasons why he thinks its worth exploring is because they can find out what Venus is made up of by taking rock samples. I think this is a good reason because it explains how the author wants to explore Venus despite its dangers. Another reason why he thinks it should be explored despite its dangers is because they can figure out why there is no life on Venus. I also think this is a good reason because it proves why Venus should be explored even though it is dangerous according to the author.

In conclusion the author has a good point of why Venus should be explored despite the dangers. One of his reasons is to find out why there is no life on Venus. Another reason is to find out what Venus is made up of. I think these are good supporting reasons because they prove why Venus should be explored even though it has dangers.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) brings students a new type of learning environment. Author Nick D'Alto wrote the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" educating readers on the new facial expression innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. NICU See. Dr. Huang and his colleague use this tool to find new ways for computers and humans to communicate. This new system brings a new type of learning, allowing the students to retain and understand information better.

D'Alto is the writer, but Dr. Huang has emphasized that FACS would bring the students a new type of online learning, making them more interested in the lesson. Dr. Huang explains this innovation as he says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor."" (Paragraph 6). This new change would make the lesson more beneficial to the student as it would make the student more interested in the lesson, further allowing them to retain information better later on.

The lesson may be beneficial to the student academically, but is it causing mental health issues as it supports more screen time? FACS is all computer based, meaning less time in the classroom and more time in front of the computer. The student would be conducting this program on a school computer as D'Alto explains, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" (Paragraph 7) the program ends up promoting more screen time, something that students should get less of, instead of human interaction, which our society needs more of. In a way FACS program is not beneficial or valuable to the student mentally as it promotes something that our society needs less of.

This technology could be also very beneficial to those who do not have the best teacher or education available to them. When FACS makes that facial emotion recognition it adjusts the lesson, allowing the students to understand the lesson better, as Dr. Huang explained. This would be beneficial to students who have a poor education environment as their teachers might not recognize these facial expressions, causing the student to not understand the lesson which later leads them to falling behind in class.

This new technology has many pros and cons, but also brings students a new way of understanding. FACS could possibly bring grades up along with educational improvement. This program may support more screen time, causing students mental health issues, along with eyesight to deteriorate, but if this program is used wisely, none of those things should happen. This new technology should bring a new way of understanding, making FACS a valuable resource to students.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

You have to make a decision on whether to make all the students perform community service let me tell you my point of view. I strongly encourage you to have all the students perform community service for various reasons. The first reason is that some places desperately need help from young willing students. Also, this will help better prepare students for work in the future. Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach students responsibility. Now, ponder my reasoning and read about all of my various ideas about this subject.

First and foremost, community service is a great way for low income and rundown places to get help from young willing students. They are strong and able to help for long periods of time. Some places, like community shelters, desperately need help because they are financially instable, and they don't have enough money to hire help. This will give them more help, and they will get things done faster. Also, this will save them a lot of money because they wouldn't have to hire anyone new. The work would get done, but at a faster and more affordable rate, not to mention that they will be very grateful.

To add to my reasoning, this experience will better help a multitude of students gain insight into what It's like to work. People spend more time working than anything else and this experience will help them prepare for that. They will know what it is like to commit to a job. They will have to work to either get enough volunteer hours or get a good grade. Furthermore, they will have to help the best they can and give one hundred percent of their efforts in order to do well and gain the respect of who they are volunteering for. This is vital for a good relationship and for an overall good grade. This will help them prepare for what It's like to work in the real world. They even may find what job they really want to do by volunteering or volunteer where they want to work.

Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach the students' responsibility. Nowadays students are lazy and just watch television or play video games all the time. This will make them strive for something better with their life. It will teach them what it means to work hard and to be dedicated. In this generation, the work ethic is at a minimum, and we are just downright lazy. This might make kids want to get up and work if they find a job or volunteering center that really interests them. They will eventually want to get up and go do their community service without being asked or told. They may even make a bond with whom they are volunteering for, and they may make a friendship for life.

In summation, volunteering is very beneficial for various reasons. First, volunteering helps places that are in need of workers and a helping hand. Also, this experience will help better prepare students when they get jobs in the future. Finally, volunteering will give the students' responsibility. These are very excellent points that I know you will carefully consider and ponder, because that is the right thing to do. This is really what volunteering is about, not the material things you do, but how you change while doing them.

Your student,

"Dear Senator,

I am writing as a concerned citizen to discuss the ongoing debate regarding the retention of the Electoral College or shifting to a popular vote system for Presidential Elections. I am of the stronger belief that maintaining our current system of the Electoral College is beneficial for stable and balanced representation.

The Electoral College, as established in the Constitution, provides a balance between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. This mechanism focuses on the objective of enhancing the voice of each state, particularly smaller ones who otherwise may be undermined in a simple popular vote system.

While the detractors claim it can be confusing for voters and lends a higher risk of “faithless” electors, occurrences of such events are rare, as trust is rarely betrayed within the established elector slates of each party. Moreover, historically, discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote are extremely infrequent, with only five instances since the founding of our country.

There are several practical reasons for preserving the Electoral College. Firstly, it provides a certainty of outcome. The existence of a winner-take-all rule in nearly all states inherently reduces the likelihood of a dispute over popular vote. Secondly, it demands a nationwide appeal from a presidential candidate, acknowledging that no single region can elect a president, ensuring a balanced and fair representation.

Critics argue that this system leads candidates to focus only on swing states during campaigns, minimizing the focus on more certain states. However, while swing states may receive more focus during campaigns, it can be argued that energizing voters in these crucial states leads to higher information dissemination and therefore a more thoughtfully informed electorate.

Finally, the Electoral College helps overcome a shortfall in the representation of larger states due to the equal representation of votes in the Senate. For instance, a win in a populous state like Florida would give a nominee 29 electoral votes, while the same win margin in Wyoming would result in just 3 votes. 

While critics suggest that the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, I believe we should perceive it as a measure to preserve our federative system and safety guard the interests of smaller states, ensuring that the candidate who becomes president truly represents all sections of our country. Therefore, I kindly urge your support in advocating for the maintenance of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"In the world, there are people who believe in aliens or supernatural beings, while some do not. The face on Mars is an example of an occurrence that causes people to believe in aliens or supernatural beings. Even though this is true, there are still many people who think the landform is a natural occurrence. There are ways to prove that this theory for the landform is true. Reasons such as the landform being compared to natural, earth landforms, and it has similar characteristics as earth landforms help prove this is true.

The landform was compared to a butte or a mess. This means it is quite similar to earthly landforms and may have occurred due to something that happened on Mars. The face on Mars is compared one main earth landform that was mentioned. The landform is Middle Butte, which is located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It was a lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa.

The face on Mars had the same look and height as an Earth landform, a mesa. It is true that there is an unusual shape to the face on Mars, there are similar occurrences that happen on Earth. Though this happens on Earth, people don't say that these Earth landforms were made by aliens.

This landform is just like other occurrences on separate planets that resemble Earth landforms. Even though the landform resembles a human face, it doesn't mean the landform is an alien's doing. Just like landforms on Earth, there are more ways than one to prove the reason or the starting place of a landform.  ",0
"Can an activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.

If more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just have a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their teammates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably is weird at the beginning, but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to doing, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.

Doing any activity outside school also work makes' people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind their goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discover and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do, they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outside the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physically, and it makes he or she has a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence its family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influences other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the or them have changed, so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.

Like always everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also, for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most common problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.  ",0
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I understand that you expect a lot out of students at

SCHOOL_NAME and want them to do they best, and just because you our principal and care a lot about us, you will do whatever it takes for us to achieve. But doing work all the time can be tiring. I think if you have a C or higher on your report card, you should be able to do sports. As long as your student are passing they should be able to have fun and play sports. Not only is sports fun, it helps us with exercising and staying in shape. If students play sports and work out, they will work they brain and other body parts. Playing sports means a lot to us hear at your school because we can come together and work as a team.

Sport shows us new things like getting your anger out in a good way, feeling good about yourself, teamwork, etc. I really hope you will let people with a C average play sports because we try our BEST here, and as long as we are giving you 110%, you should let us play sports and enjoy our selves !

"Successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks. They know that in order to achieve great things, they need to push themselves outside their comfort zone. This willingness to experiment and take risks is what sets them apart from others and allows them to reach their full potential.

For example, consider the story of Bill Gates. He was a college dropout who started a software company in his garage. At the time, most people thought he was crazy for trying something so risky. But Gates was not afraid to take a chance. He knew that if he didn't try something new, he would never achieve his goals. And his gamble paid off. Gates is now one of the richest and most successful people in the world.

Another example is Elon Musk. He is the founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and several other successful companies. He is a risk-taker who is always trying new things. For example, when other people were afraid to send people into space, Musk founded SpaceX to make space travel accessible to everyone. His willingness to take risks has led to many groundbreaking innovations.

Successful people know that in order to achieve great things, they need to push themselves outside their comfort zone. They are not afraid to try new things and take risks. This willingness to experiment and take risks is what sets them apart from others and allows them to reach their full potential.

"There is no doubt that our society has become increasingly wasteful in recent years. We are producing more and more garbage, and much of it is plastic bags and other types of packaging. This is a major problem, because plastic bags and other types of packaging are not biodegradable, meaning that they do not break down and decompose naturally. As a result, they accumulate in our environment, posing a serious threat to both our ecology and our health.

There are several reasons why this has happened. One is that we have become increasingly reliant on plastic bags and other types of packaging. They are cheap and convenient, and so we use them without thinking about the consequences. Another reason is that our waste disposal systems are not adequate. We have not developed the infrastructure necessary to recycle or properly dispose of all this waste, and so it ends up in our environment.

Ultimately, we need to take responsibility for our own actions. We need to start using less plastic bags and other types of packaging, and we need to demand that our governments do more to develop the necessary waste disposal systems. Only then will we be able to protect our environment and our health.

"I think limiting car usage is a great idea for America. Studies show that in Bogotá, ""the people are generating a revolutionary change."" Says Enrique Rear, the major of Asunción, Paraguay. People are either walking to their destinations or riding their bicycles. Also, the less you use your car, means less air pollution everywhere, so the Earth is healthier.

Limiting car usage could also help people's physical and mental health. Walking could lower your stress levels and let you think about the nature that you see instead of thinking about what your mad at. I know this from experience because I get stressed very easily and walking anywhere helps me calm down. Another thing about limiting car usage is that the car wreck percentage would be lower than it is right now. There would also be fewer deaths in the world if they limited the usage of cars.

Did you know that there are prominently 118 miles of bicycle paths only in Bogotá? Well there is and according to Mocks, the city's major, ""It's the most of any Latin American city."" Also, you could use the bicycle paths as walking paths for exercise or just to walk anywhere. People would be in more shape if they limited cars. But the only bad thing about using a car in Vauban, Germany is that you have to pay for the car and a spot to keep it while only being able to drive it on the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

In conclusion I think it would be a great idea for America to go car-free.",0
" Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my strong support for the continued use of the Electoral College as the current method for choosing the President of the United States. Furthermore, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our political system and provides several benefits that are difficult to replicate through a popular vote. Furthermore, I appreciate your consideration of my perspective on this important issue.

First and foremost, I believe that the Electoral College provides a sense of national representation in the election process. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its population, which means that larger states have a greater influence on the outcome of the election than smaller states. This means that candidates must pay attention to all regions of the country and not just focus on densely populated areas, as they would in a popular vote system. This ensures that the best candidate for the job is elected, regardless of where they come from.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a degree of certainty in the election process. While electoral votes can still be contested, it is much less likely than a popular vote contested by a losing candidate. This means that the country can move forward quickly after an election, without the long and drawn-out process of a recount or court challenge.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it forces candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters. In a popular vote system, candidates may focus on smaller, more liberal or conservative regions, depending on which group they believe will vote for them. However, in the Electoral College, candidates must appeal to voters across the country, which ensures that they are addressing the needs of all Americans.

Finally, the Electoral College helps to prevent the tyranny of the majority. While a popular vote system may seem like the most direct way to choose a president, it can also lead to the unintended consequences of suppressing the voices of minority groups. By giving each state a certain number of votes, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the will of the people as a whole, rather than just the will of the majority.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our political system. It ensures that all voices are heard, that the best candidate for the job is elected, and that the country can move forward quickly after an election. I urge you to continue supporting the use of the Electoral College in future elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"We should keep the Electoral College it's a good process, and it keeps us from having the problem of elections in which no candidates receive a majority of the votes cast. Like in 1968 with Nixon and in 1992 in Clinton were they only got 43 percent plurality of the popular votes but with the Electoral College which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no chance of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, an idea of this is like a Republican in California. The Electoral College needs a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal like South, Northeast,etc. With the Electoral College is UN likelier than a dispute over the popular vote. It happened in 2000 because that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. An example is in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non Democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overpowered by declaring the candidate who get the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are right in debating that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When u vote you're not voting for the presidential u pick for're actually voting for a slate of electors. Both party each selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, but that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral college is good to stay.

The Electoral College helps with Certainty of outcome, Everyone's president, Swing states, Big States, Avoid run off elections. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total of numbers of votes are 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. The new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. So other being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign that a small state does. Voters in a presidential election are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.",0
"What do most people think can do things better, people or machines? I, like most people, believe things are done better by hand. Would someone want a lifesaving operation done by a living doctor that knows what is going on and where things are, or a robot that is programmed to do it and could malfunction. I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times.

Cars do not actually see the things that surround them. If the driver decides not to pay attention and one of the cars sensors were to malfunction then the lives of many people hang in balance. Road constructions and traffic jams could pose a threat as well. When these things happen do the cars just shut down or try and get through themselves. Either way major safety hazards will arise. Just like in paragraph 2, right now ""driverless"" cars cannot even get out of a driveway alone. Unless some major adjustments were to come soon, driverless cars remain a huge threat to safety.

What if someone were to get hurt in a driverless car accident? The car malfunctions and the driver could not take control and gets hurt. Who willingly takes responsibility, the driver or the company? Like stated in paragraph 9, to figure this out the country would have to make more laws. All that will waste a large amount of time for both the companies that make driverless cars and congress who makes the laws. Driverless cars will give people trouble before they even hit the road.

I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times. No matter what driverless cars do not have the instances and emotions as humans. Cars cannot see what lies 500 feet in front of them, only humans can see that. Technology fails too much and letting cars drive for us poses to great of a threat at this time.",0
"The main advantages that people seem to find in the less use of cars is that the bad and harmful emissions given off are being reduced. The amount of emissions entering our air daily is beyond belief. In Germany, passenger cars are guilty of 12 percent of the emissions; while here in America we give off 57 percent. Germany has made the change to allow you to have a car if it is parked in a city garage not near the living quarters, or you can pay $40,000 to have your own ""large"" garage. All malls, stores and parks are just within a walking distance. With the decrease in the number of cars, the access of public transportation has risen. Paris has recently joined this trend. Days after the record amount of pollution in the air clean air was just a must for these people. The next day you were ordered to leave your cars in the garage, or you would be fined a fine of 22 euros(31 dollars).

Within the lack of cars moving around the people, digestion was down 60 percent in as little as 5 days. 27 people wanted to avoid the fine, so they had their cars impounded. France blamed the Diesel fuel. Dismal makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The goal is to promote alternative transportation. The idea that transportation emissions need to go away has led to this,"" these people are generating a revolutionary change. This change is crossing our borders."" Imagine bright red and yellow slides, green and blue swings with tons of kids running and screaming together, or 24 kids all split up into teams for a fun, friendly neighborhood game of kickball. This is what could happen if more countries begin to do what Columbia did. Children would have more access to parks and sports centers.

"Title: Suburban Life Beyond Cars: A Green and Healthy Pathway 

The contemporary world and its patterns of urbanization and mobility have evolved primarily around the use of cars. Cities and suburbs are populated with extensive parking areas and highways, designed to accommodate automobile use. However, there is a shift towards limiting car usage due to numerous socio-economic and environmental benefits as demonstrated by examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States.

In Vauban, an experimental suburb in Germany, the idea of “smart planning” takes center stage as residents give up on cars, leading to a more peaceful, tension-free community (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 1-4). This has become possible through a city layout with reduced space for cars and widespread public transportation systems. The focus is on making suburbs more compact and bring shops a walkaway, which not only improves accessibility but also significantly reduces greenhouse emissions from cars (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5-7).

In Paris, smog pollution led authorities to enforce a partial driving ban during a day, creating a significant reduction in congestion and demonstrating an approach to smog reduction (Duffer, “Paris bans driving due to smog” 10, 14). Similarly, in Colombia, the annual car-free day when only buses and taxis are allowed has played a vital role in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Silky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" 21, 23-24). 

American cities too are witnessing change. There has been a decline in car purchasing and more people are driving less (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 29-30), largely due to changing social attitudes and improved public transportation. With this shift, the demand for cars is likely going to decrease further, while encouraging a long-term cultural shift of less car usage (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 34-35).

Therefore, limiting car usage brings a multitude of benefits. One of the main advantages is the significant environmental impact. Car emissions are one of the major contributors to harmful greenhouse gases, causing global warming and air pollution (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5). Reducing car usage benefits not only the environment but also public health, as demonstrated by the decreased smog levels in Paris and Bogotá. 

Socio-economically, mobility shifts within communities also lead to changes in living habits that promote healthier, more active lifestyles, driving positive community bonds. Opportunities for businesses to thrive are also visible, with public transport facilities, carpooling apps and car-sharing programs becoming more appealing in a car-reduced society (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 37). 

In sum, severely reducing car usage leads to healthier, more sustainable, and more cohesive cities and suburbs. Although these adjustments may seem challenging, the adoption of public transport services and smart-planning, supplemented by forward-looking regulations and policies can make the transition smooth and beneficial, nudging us towards a greener, healthier and more resilient future.",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer serves the needs of the American people.

The Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. At the time, the country was much smaller and less diverse than it is today, and there was no way to ensure that a popular vote would be fair and representative of the will of the people.

However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary or appropriate. The country is now much larger and more diverse, and we have the technology to conduct a fair and accurate popular vote. In fact, most other democracies in the world elect their leaders by popular vote.

There are many reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is undemocratic. In a popular vote, every vote would count equally. But in the Electoral College, a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. For example, a voter in Wyoming has 3.6 times more power than a voter in California.

Second, the Electoral College can lead to presidents who do not win the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In that election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states. This is because a candidate can win the presidency with just 270 electoral votes, and it is much easier to win a majority of the electoral votes by winning a few swing states than by winning the popular vote nationwide.

Fourth, the Electoral College is confusing and difficult to understand. Many Americans do not understand how it works, and even those who do understand it often find it unfair.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that should be abolished. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the president by popular vote.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

"A computer can not tell if your happy or if your sad, or if your confused or upset or anger. You can act like your happy and not really be happy people do it all the time they put on a mask.

You can move the muscles in your face it also talks about how when you smile you become happy so acting happy makes you happy. You can't just become happy by smiling used there's something that makes you happy so if you said and smiling makes it better than why are there so many sad and depressing people out there. If smiling makes you so happy why isn't the world just a wonderful place.

"While driverless cars present some benefits, on the whole their development should be approached cautiously. 

According to the article, autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents substantially since 90% of crashes are currently caused by human error. Without human involvement in operation, vehicles could communicate with each other to coordinate movement efficiently and prevent collisions. This safety aspect is an important consideration. 

However, the technology also raises serious concerns that have not been fully addressed. Privacy is one issue, as driverless cars would rely on sensors and data collection to function, allowing personal information to be tracked. More significantly, turning over control of vehicles to computers may have unforeseen consequences. While programmers aim to account for every scenario, it is impossible to predict every situation that could arise on roads with other human drivers still in control of most vehicles. Autonomous systems may make mistakes that result in accidents or even fatalities through no intentional fault of their own. Until the technology is proven to match or exceed human abilities in all conditions, this risk cannot be ignored.

Perhaps the wisest approach is to advance driverless cars gradually through rigorous testing before widespread adoption, especially since the legal responsibility in accidents would be complex to determine. Developers must ensure that these vehicles can respond appropriately to any situation, with appropriate safeguards against data privacy violations or technical failures. Only once autonomous driving is conclusively demonstrated to be as safe or safer than human ability in all typical driving contexts should significant integration into our transportation system be considered. While promising benefits exist, premature or careless deployment could have devastating outcomes that outweigh any advantages. Overall the technology demands further refinement before relying on it extensively.

In conclusion, driverless cars show potential to reduce accidents but also introduce novel safety and ethical concerns. A cautious approach prioritizing thorough testing is prudent before large-scale implementation or dependence on autonomous vehicles. The complexity demands careful consideration of all factors to ensure public well-being as this transformative technology progresses.",1
"Even though driverless cars are coming in the near future and have a lot of positive and negative aspects in my opinion I support the development for driverless cars. To convey why Driverless cars are a good thing is because is can save a lot of time and fossil fuel and is a lot more convent. For instance when the author states that, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and far more flexibility than a bus. This line states how driveless cars can change the world for better and are going to be more apart then riding the bus.

Some more interesting facts about the smart cars that make me more support it is when the passage talks about the Driving and the Assisting. For instance author talks about how,""Traffic Jam Assistant."" ""The can handle driving functions at the speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" I think this is a good thing because it makes driving more a lot more safe for the driver, but at the same time does not sacrifice the drivers control of the car, and it will alert you if you need to take control of the car, which I think is very important, so there won't be any accidents.

To argue why would you need a driverless car if you can just drive yourself is a very important question. Driverless Cars can be helpful and can maybe even save your life if you come across some reckless driver on the road. For example when passage states how, Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" This line describes how the driverless Cars have many safety features and can be automatic turned off just in case of emergencies, which makes it even more convenient and a lot safer for the driver.

To summarize my argument on self driving cars is that I think it's going to be a huge advancement for humanity and will improve our lifestyles for the better. The features in the passage that describes these smart cars such as the heads-up display, which is entiretantment system and information system which, can be turned off automatically in case of emergencies. Also, the Antilock brake and driver assistance, which can save a lot of lives.

These safety features are going to make driverless cars a success. Driverless cars are going to be apart part for the future and will improve the way we drive and our action as well and save many lives.",0
"As a fellow citizen, I strongly believe that limiting car usage is essential for our community. The passages provided offer numerous reasons to support this idea.

Firstly, using cars less often can improve our health significantly. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Walking and cycling are excellent ways to stay active, and by limiting car usage, we can incorporate these activities into our daily routine. Moreover, the exercise we get from walking and cycling can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Secondly, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases that contribute to climate change and damage our respiratory health. The European Cyclists' Federation states that cycling emits 5-10 times less CO2 than driving a car. By choosing to cycle or walk instead of driving, we can significantly decrease the amount of air pollution in our community.

Thirdly, limiting car usage can benefit our economy. According to the European Commission, cycling and walking can reduce traffic congestion, which costs businesses and individuals time and money. In addition, investing in cycling infrastructure can create jobs and stimulate local economies. By promoting cycling and walking, we can boost our community's economy and create a more prosperous future.

Lastly, limiting car usage can improve our quality of life. The passage from the European Commission also states that cycling and walking can improve our mental health and overall well-being. By spending less time in cars and more time outdoors, we can reduce stress levels, improve our mood, and enjoy the beauty of nature.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is crucial for our health, environment, economy, and quality of life. By choosing to walk or cycle instead of driving, we can make a positive impact on our community and create a better future for ourselves and future generations. I urge all citizens to join me in this effort and embrace a healthier, more sustainable way of living.",1
"Education is a life-long process that helps us learn new things and develop new skills. I definitely agree that education is a life-long process. There are always new things to learn, and we can always improve our skills.

One reason why I agree that education is a life-long process is that technology is always changing. We have to keep up with the latest technologies if we want to be successful in today's world. For example, if we want to work in a field that requires computer skills, we need to keep learning about new software and tools.

Another reason why I agree that education is a life-long process is that the world is always changing. We need to stay up-to-date on current events and understand how the world works if we want to be successful. For example, if we want to work in a field like international relations, we need to be familiar with different cultures and understand the complex geopolitical landscape.

Finally, I think that education is a life-long process because it helps us develop new skills. We can always become better at problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. For example, if we want to become a better leader, we can take courses in leadership development.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process that helps us learn new things, develop new skills, and stay up-to-date on current events. It's essential for success in today's world.

"Have you ever been torn between multiple things to say or do? I have, but I went to my family for the help I needed. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present.

Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. In order to make the best decision, you must go to the people you trust the most: your family. Family is always there for you, even when life seems at it's lowest. Asking the younger members in your family for advice might not be the brightest choice to make, but going to your elders is the best possible choice to make while seeking advice. Looking up to your elder family members is the best thing you can do when seeking opinions because, they have the most knowledge about how to act socially, and you know that you can fully trust them with what you're telling them. An instance where your elders come in, is what to say and when. Almost all teenagers have been made fun of or been in some form of drama and, they don't know what to say back to the bullies. That's where your elders come in. Your elders already know what it's like to feel that way, so they understand greatly. They give you multiple opinions and options to choose from when confronting the bullies. Many teenagers, including me have successfully stood up to bullies after talking with elder family members.

Let's face it, we've all had to face some terrifying situations and, we didn't know what to do. But we all have our families to guide us to make the right choices. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. Next time that you're being faced with a challenge, go to your family. They will support you no matter what.",0
"Success is not a one-size-fits-all concept. It varies from person to person, depending on the goals they set for themselves. Some may view success as achieving financial stability, while others may consider it as having a happy family life. Therefore, I fully agree that true success can be measured primarily in terms of the goals one sets for oneself. In this essay, I will provide several reasons and examples to support my stance.

Firstly, setting goals for oneself is crucial for achieving success. Without setting goals, we tend to go through life aimlessly without any clear direction of where we are going. Setting goals, on the other hand, gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life. It also helps us to prioritize our time and resources towards achieving our desired outcome. For instance, a student who sets a goal to achieve a certain grade in a particular course will work hard towards attaining that goal by studying regularly, attending classes, and seeking help when necessary.

Secondly, measuring success based on personal goals provides a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. When we achieve the goals we set for ourselves, we feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This feeling of self-fulfillment is essential for our overall well-being and sense of purpose in life. For example, a person who sets a goal to run a marathon and trains for months to achieve that goal will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon completing the race.

Moreover, setting personal goals allows us to measure our progress and make necessary adjustments. By setting specific goals, we can measure our progress and determine if we are on the right track. If we are not making progress, we can adjust our strategies and change our approach to achieve our desired outcome. For instance, a person who sets a goal to lose weight can track their progress by regularly weighing themselves and measuring their waistline. If they are not making progress, they can adjust their diet and exercise routine to achieve their goal.

On the other hand, if success were to be measured solely based on external factors such as wealth, status, or fame, it would be difficult to achieve true success. The reason is that these factors are often beyond our control, and we may not have the necessary resources or opportunities to attain them. However, by setting personal goals, we can focus on what we can control and work towards attaining them.

In conclusion, true success can be measured primarily in terms of the goals one sets for oneself. Setting personal goals is crucial for achieving success, measuring progress, and making necessary adjustments. It also provides a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment when we achieve the goals we set for ourselves. Therefore, it is essential to set personal goals and work towards achieving them.

"I am in grade 8 and I would like to talk about the issue of gun control, which is a highly contentious topic in many countries. I am in favor of stricter gun control laws because I believe that this will help reduce the number of deaths caused by guns.

One reason why I support stricter gun control laws is that it will make it harder for criminals to obtain guns. If there are more background checks and waiting periods for purchasing a gun, then criminals will have a harder time getting their hands on one. This will ultimately reduce the amount of gun-related crime in our society.

Furthermore, stricter gun control laws will also make it harder for people with mental health issues to get guns. If we have more thorough background checks and screenings, then we can prevent mentally ill individuals from purchasing guns. This will help reduce the number of mass shootings that are often committed by mentally unstable individuals.

Lastly, I believe that stricter gun control laws will also help reduce accidental shootings. If there are more regulations and requirements for gun owners to properly store their guns, then this will reduce the likelihood of accidental shootings occurring, especially around children.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are necessary for our society. They will make it harder for criminals to obtain guns, help reduce gun-related crime and mass shootings, and also reduce the likelihood of accidental shootings occurring.",1
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of implementing a four-day work week in schools:

Hey, so like, have you heard about this thing where schools might start having a four-day work week? I know, it sounds kinda weird, but I think it could be pretty cool. I mean, think about it, we'd have more time to hang out with our friends, do stuff we like, and just chill. But, there are also some pretty big pros and cons to it, so we have to think about that too.

First, let's talk about the good stuff. If schools had a four-day work week, we'd have more time to do stuff outside of school. Like, I love playing video games and watching YouTube videos, and with an extra day off, I could do that even more. Plus, my parents are always bugging me to help with chores and stuff, and with an extra day, I could get more stuff done without feeling so overwhelmed. And, let's be real, who doesn't love having an extra day to sleep in and relax? It's like, the best.

But, there are also some pretty big cons to it. Like, teachers and other staff members might not be super happy about it. They might have to work longer hours on the days they are in school, which could be pretty tough. And, some people might be worried about how it could affect their grades and stuff. I mean, if we're not in school as much, might we not learn as much? That's a pretty big concern.

And, there's also the thing about money. I know schools need money to run and stuff, and if they have a four-day work week, they might not have as much money to spend on things like supplies and stuff. That could be pretty bad.

So, like, overall, I think a four-day work week in schools could be pretty cool, but we have to think about all the pros and cons and make sure it's going to be good for everyone. I mean, we don't want teachers and staff to be super stressed out or for students to not learn as much. It's like, a pretty big decision",1
"Dear Principle,

I think that the principle is being unfair because students are actually trying there best on having good grades. I think he should give them one more chance because there trying best. If you don't do anything about them, we would were going to sign a petition and were going to get the whole students get it sigh even the teachers. If you still don't let them play a sport then were going to get our super attended on this and I know he would do something about it because he's nice. He's going to see that were trying our best on our grades.

So either you want to do it the nice way or you want to do it the bad way? It's your choice were just letting you know before we go and do it the bad way. It's not fair that you're taking our sports away from us that's the only good thing we have in school and friends so please I'm asking nicely don't take our sports away from us.

We promise were going to try our best on getting a better grade then before. We promise were going to stay to tutoring at least twice a week if we have to we don't really care because we don't want to lose our sport.

Furthermore, we fight for what we want please give us another chance?

"Working in a group can be beneficial in an academic setting as it allows for increased collaboration, creativity, and new perspectives. By discussing tasks, researching topics, or completing tasks together, it can significantly increase the quality and efficiency of the work. For example, if working on a group project in an Introduction to Psychology class, different members can bring their unique viewpoints and perspectives, allowing the final project to be more comprehensive and creative than if one student had completed the project alone. 

However, there can be drawbacks to working in a group. In addition to the potential challenge of coordinating schedules and meeting times, other issues can arise, such as potential discrepancies between the amount of work each person contributes and the weight of each member's contribution. This could lead to conflict and a less than ideal outcome. For example, if two people in a group are especially invested in a project, but the other two contribute little effort, the final result could be negatively impacted. 

In conclusion, although working in an academic setting with a group can be beneficial in several ways, the potential issues within the group may outweigh any potential benefits in some cases.",1
"I would like our election to be cast on popular vote. It would make more sense for us to be able to elect our president by what everyone thinks and not the electoral college because many things can go wrong. The votes in electoral college don't make sense big states have more votes than the little ones so the candidates focus on big states and the other ones are left out because they have two or three votes. That's why I think we need a different system or just cast it on popular vote.

Just like the 2000s election Bush won that by getting the bigger states when Gore should've won it because he had more popular votes. The electoral college makes no sense and should be taken down. Many people disagree with the electoral college and know it's a big scam for the presidents to win by losing. That's why it should be cast on popular so it's fair for people and not on the size of your state.

The electoral college is an outdated, unfair system on voting. It shouldn't be about the state but what all the country thinks. Popular vote is the best way to calculate who should be president and who not to be. Our nation would be better off with a new system because the electoral college is getting outdated and isn't a good way to vote for who leads our country. We need a new system because in several places they have never seen a candidate or ad to vote in 2000 campaign. Those states didn't see anything because of their electoral votes are small compared to those of the bigger states.

Also, you can tie the votes in electoral votes, and then we'd have to worry about the vote our House of Representatives would give us. That could be a disaster for us to worry about. Just like Nixon and Clinton had 43 percent of popular vote but winning in the electoral college. It's not fair for most people, and it doesn't make sense how he can win but still be losing at the same time. I wouldn't vote until this system is changed because it is completely unfair.

The electoral college is an unfair system that no one wants anymore. We can change our ways of voting, so it'll be more fair, and it matters on our country's thoughts not our states. Popular vote seems more reasonable and a better way for us to find a good leader. That's why I think it should be cast on popular vote instead of the electoral college and the United States of America would be better off with what our whole country thinks instead of our size because we represent freedom and need to prove it.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME I agree with you're choice to not allow students to participate in sports and other activities because it will both encourage the students who are already working hard to keep doing so, and it will urge the students who are not doing well to try harder. I think that as a result of your choice more students will try harder in all of their classes, but I also see why you should not make that choice based on the effect it will have on the students. For the students who are doing well they might turn into bullies and start to pick on the students who are not doing so well. For the students who are not doing well it may depress them in two ways one way it could affect them is making them a target for bullies and that ties into the second effect sadness which can lead to the even greater plummet into them failing and then depression and lack of confidence. My stance is that you should change the policy.  ",0
"Being a good person and a good citizen are two important qualities that people should strive for in life. By researching these qualities, one can gain insight into how their own problems can affect their career, and how exhibiting good behaviors can help them in life. It is also important to be a good student in order to gain credit for college, as well as to be responsible and work hard to complete goals. Lastly, helping other people can make a huge impact, and demonstrates good behavior. It can be as simple as offering a lending hand to a neighbor, or donating to a local cause. All in all, developing and exhibiting qualities of a good person and citizen are essential for a thriving and successful life.",1
" It is true that many students desire to graduate early with all the necessary credits, but few are able to achieve this due to the high standards required. While some may prefer to take the full four years of high school to graduate, others would like to take the shorter route and still obtain all the necessary credits. However, achieving this goal is not an easy task, and it requires a significant amount of effort and dedication.

In my opinion, it would be beneficial for students to have the option to graduate with three years of high school, provided that they are willing to put in the extra effort to complete the required courses. By doing so, they would be able to finish their high school education earlier and move on to college, work, and a career at a younger age. This would be particularly advantageous for students who do not enjoy spending too much time on schoolwork and would like to achieve their goals more quickly.

I have seen firsthand the benefits of early graduation. Some of my friends have graduated early due to their excellent grades, which gave them enough credits to graduate. They are now in college, pursuing their dreams and achieving their goals. I believe that it would be a good idea to give other students the same opportunity if they choose to take it.

In conclusion, while graduating early with all the necessary credits is a challenging task, it is definitely achievable with hard work and dedication. Providing students with the option to graduate with three years of high school would be a valuable addition to the educational system, as it would allow students to finish their high school education earlier and move on to the next stage of their lives.",1
"Mona Lisa's facial expressions were ""determined"" by the Facial Action Coding System. It determined that she was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent anger"" (D'Alto). This super high-tech machine can identify your emotions based on analyzing the muscles in your face. But is the technology really needed in classrooms?

The knowledge of emotional expressions to teachers can be very beneficial. Everyone knows that kids don't learn the same and keep up at the same pace. Teachers could use this for kids to know how comfortable they are with the lesson. In the text it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor'"" (D'Alto). This shows that FACS can help students who don't understand the lesson, by looking at their facial expressions, and changing the lesson to fit them.

Others would argue that facial expressions for every person and emotion are different. As the author pointed out in the text, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (D'Alto), people will disbelieve because not every person shows the same emotion the same way. Some opposers would argue that the addition of the system to education would drastically bring up the cost. Making schools more expensive and put schools at an advantage.

Although I agree that not every face makes the same expression,

FACS can identify the way the muscles move to indicate the emotion. In the text it states, ""This process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto). This quote shows how the system works and to identify the muscle movement in your face. While, yes the cost of education will increase due to the addition of FACS, the benefits will outlay the costs. Like any technological addition to schools, they use funds and sponsors to help pay for that stuff. Helping kids find a new way to learn and helping them succeed, seems a lot more important than costs.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System will help teachers and students worldwide succeed. When teachers know how to fix their lessons based on how their students learn, it makes the job easier for them, and they get to see their students grow. Although the FACS was able to identify Mona Lisa's facial expressions, they can be used for so much more in the real world.",0
"Computer games are loved by children and Adults alike. The reason why they are so popular is mainly because they are a great way for children to learn new things and have fun. However, some people think that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual as well as psychological development. Consequently, they suggest that effective measures should be taken to prevent children from playing them.

One of the most common problems that computer games can cause is that they can be very addictive. Children who are addicted to computer games often find it hard to break the habit. This can lead to them spending more and more time playing the game, which can cause them to lose touch with reality. It also can make them less motivated to learn or do other things.

Another common problem is that computer games can be very dangerous. Children who play computer games often do not know what they are getting themselves into. They can become very injured or even killed. This can have a very negative effect on their development, both physically and mentally.

Most of the people who argue that computer games have negative effects on children's development are not actually children themselves. They are adults who have already had some experience with computer games. These people are usually people who are not interested in helping children grow up healthy and happy.

One of the best ways to prevent children from playing computer games is to make sure that they are not really interested in them. This can be done by education. It is also important to make sure that the games that children play are not too dangerous. If they are, then they should be removed from the classroom.

Finally, it is important to remember that computer games are not the only things that can be bad for children. Other things that can also have a negative effect on their development include television, books, and other forms of communication. Therefore, it is important that parents be aware of the dangers that computer games pose to their children.

"Cell Phone Use While Driving

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using any kind of possibly distracting technology while operating a vehicle can put the driver, and others, at serious risk. Many people do not fully understand the risks that come with using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. While distracted driving they could hit someone or something, possibly leaving the driver and that person or thing seriously injured, damaged, or dead. These are just a few reasons for why drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In 2015, the NSC estimated that cell phone use while driving, alone, accounted for 27% of all car crashes in the United States and 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities. Also in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 310,000 people injured in accidents involving distracted driving. In the U.S. nine people are killed each day from distracted driving. Car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.S. This distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. These statistics rise every year. And with technological advances in cars, radios, phones, etc., there are many things that can easily distract any driver. Drivers should keep in mind that it is okay to leave a text unread for a couple of minutes in order to safely respond when the vehicle is stopped and off the road. Or pull over if it is important to respond quickly. There is rarely an emergency so severe and emergent that a person would need to put themselves and others at risk of serious injury or even death, because if something happens to that person, they can not help in an emergency situation anyway.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is extremely dangerous and risky. Drivers are not only putting them self in harm's way when using a cell phone while driving, but they are also putting other's lives and safety on the line. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",0
"Students are usually on their phones and doing other mindless tasks during summer break, and they don't stimulate their brains. As a result, some schools assign summer projects to ensure that their students learn over the summer and are better prepared for the next school year. These schools debate on assigning teacher-designed projects, which have specific guidelines, or student-designed projects, which allow for more creative freedom. These summer projects should be student-designed because students would be able to personalize their projects, the projects would be more enjoyable, and the students would put in more effort into their products.

With student-designed projects, students are able to express their own creative styles. For example, in an interior design class, the summer project could be to design the students' dream house. One student may excel in drawing, so they could draw their dream house. Another student may excel in graphic design, so they could create a three-dimensional model of their dream house on a computer. Lastly, another student may like Legos, so they could build their dream house out of Legos. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects would minimize the creative freedom because they would set specific guidelines on how they want their students to complete it. All in all, students can complete their projects using the unique skills they have with student-designed projects.

Also, students would find the projects more fun if they are able to design it. Summer break is a time for students to have fun. When a teacher designs a project, there are usually set guidelines on how they want the project, which sometimes isn't what students would enjoy. This would make it difficult for students to find the motivation to complete their projects, especially over summer break. On the other hand, with student-designed projects, students would be able to personalize their projects, so they could use their own interests to complete it. When students are able to individualize their projects, they find it more enjoyable to complete since they would include aspects that they enjoy and minimize aspects of the project they could potentially dislike. For example, in the previously mentioned interior design summer project, the student who excels in drawing could dislike using computers. If the teacher had required the dream house to be made on the computer, the drawer could find it difficult to finish the project because they don't enjoy using computers. In contrast, if the drawer was able to design their own project, then they could draw their dream house while having fun.

Lastly, in student-designed projects, students would put more effort into completing their projects. Generally, students put more effort into the subjects that they enjoy. Similarly, if students are able to design their own projects, they would enjoy completing the projects and work harder on them. If the previously mentioned interior design teacher required everyone to build their dream house out of Legos, the student who draws and the student who enjoys graphic design would enjoy the project less and find little motivation to complete it over the summer. As a result, the drawer and graphic designer would put minimal effort into their Lego dream house, for they may just build a house with little detail and minimal unique thinking. On the other hand, if the dream house project was a student-designed project, the students would put a lot of effort into creating their dream house since they are able to design it with the skills that they have and enjoy using.

Some may argue that students could design the summer projects, so they require minimum effort since they want to complete their projects as quickly as possible. However, when you give students creative freedom, they are more likely to put in extra effort because they would enjoy their projects more. Schools that require summer projects should assign student-designed projects because students are able to use their unique skills and interests to complete these projects. Additionally, students would have more fun completing these projects since they are allowed to express their own creativeness, which helps motivate the students to complete it during summer break. Lastly, students are more likely to work harder on their projects because they would find their student-designed projects more enjoyable to complete.",0
"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering two new phone policies. Policy 1 is about letting us, the students, bring our phones to school and being able to use them at lunch and other free times. While Policy 2 is not letting us have our phones at all while at school. As a student myself I have to agree more with Policy 1. Letting us use our phones during lunch and other free times would let us communicate more with each other. During class most of what we think about is probably what we are going to say to our friends the next time we see them. Since we have no time to coordinate where to go for free time with our friends we might miss them. If we could use our phones to text them we could meet up. A friend that is sick and missing classes might want to catch up on work, so they don't get too far behind. The friend at school could call them at lunch or free time and tell them if anything important is going on. Along with telling them about school work, we wouldn't want them to get too bored, now, would we? Our friends are how we get through the day. They are what makes us look at the white board and say ""I can get this. I can learn."" When we are lost they're the ones who put us back on track and the ones who show us the way. If you allow us to use our phones outside the classroom they can do all of these things from across the school, and I'm sure that we would do much better inside the classroom. Phones are the way that we keep up our friendships with those that we never see. I have a friend that the only time I see her is if we happen to go to the same place for free time. Once in a while we will run into each other in the hall and say where to meet but only like once a month. All her classes are upstairs while mine are all downstairs and on the other side of the school. Can you guess the way we've stayed in contact? Yep, that's right, cell phones! To some it may sound stupid and cheesy, but cell phones are what keeps our lives together. Unless you would rather put all friends together in one classroom, I think the best way to go is Policy 1.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0
"Luke Merger had no idea how his life would change after graduating high school. After graduating from high school Luke Bombers friend asked his if he wanted to go on a cattle boat. The reason they had the cattle boats was because World War II had just ended in Europe. After World War II ended many countries were crumbling. They needed the cattle boats for milk and meet to feed the people who had no home because of the war. I will list some reasons why he said yes.

A reason Luke Merger joined the cattle boat knew it would be fun. Another reason Luke Merger joined the Europe on a cattle boat trip was because he said ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke went on his first trip in August 1945 when he had orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and the other crew members arrived on the 14th of August 1945.

"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth and is also referred to as our sister planet. We have sent many probes to Venus, yet many have not survived more than a few hours. Venus may be very close to us compared to other planets in our solar system, but it is far different in its characteristics. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author shows how Venus is dangerous but still worthy of studying by giving us evidence and examples about Venus and its features.

The author gives us statistical evidence on how our planet is different from Venus. He explains that its temperature, atmosphere, and its acidic clouds are making the planet uninhabitable for humans. The author writes, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (3) The other spits out many facts that support his claim that exploring Venus is a very dangerous job. 800 degrees Fahrenheit is very hot and would not EB suitable by a human. In fact, all of these features would make it hard for a human to live on Venus. All these points can help prove that Venus is still worthy of studying even though there are many dangers because it should interest scientists and others to find out how these conditions came to be, what could survive in these harmful conditions, and even possibly how to make it possible for humans to live there.

The author also uses examples to support his claim that Venus is inhospitable for humans. Humans have many needs in order to survive on a planet and Venus does not qualify for many. The author writes ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" (3) In this quote the either is referring to the pressure of the planet inside the atmosphere. If a submarine could not survive the pressure, I doubt a human could either. The author also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system"" and it has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This is impressive because even probes that are specifically made for going to Venus, can't even survive on Venus. This proves that Venus is very dangerous but still worthy of studying because it challenges scientists to find new ways of making stronger probes and new ways to study this planet that prove effective.

The author uses many pieces of statistical evidence and examples to prove his point that Venus is worthy of studying even considering the dangerous conditions. It is worthy because it has insanely harsh temperature, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and other harmful characteristics. Would you want to study Venus considering its deadly differences?",0
"Imagine being on a vacation in the Bahama's and realize that you have to finish two book reports by the end of the trip. Now your vacation is totally ruined! You now are going to have to postpone relaxing and having fun, because you have to do school work before classes even start. The majority of schools around the country include summer learning assignments; which purposes as a way to help students get ready for their upcoming classes. This could include a genre of ideas of work to be assigned that teachers could choose from. Most student's don't enjoy these projects; since, most kids don't want to start thinking about school until, the doors are open again. They would usually prepare you at a younger age with summer reading to help the gradual adjustment to essays, projects, and many more, easier to do. The issue is that, more and more students forget or never finish, these summer homework assignments, due to the lack of enjoyment or increased procrastination. So if you could choose your own project, would it be more likely that you would complete it?

If students could create their own homework assignments, what would it look like? A student could choose topics such as, sports, television, friends, family, location, or anything else that they could think of. Maybe if teachers assigned essays over break, students could choose what to write about. For instance, maybe they would like to explain what they did during summer or, describe their favorite sport, food, TV show, and even create a bibliography about themselves. I know that many students still wouldn't enjoy writing or reading over their summer vacation; but, what if a student could choose to do anything they wanted, instead of writing. They could make a picture collage, poster, PowerPoint, painting, or whatever they'd want, to show how their vacation is going or why they like a particular topic. If your school let you pick what to work on during break, what would you choose?

Why do students prefer not to do these assignments in the first place? What are teachers asking kids to do that's so uninteresting? Since you started enrolling in school, your teachers would choose to give you work during summer break. This was to help kids be more comfortable before starting the following school year. It usually starts with summer reading to help lead up to research projects or essays. If you're about to start entering AP classes, you're more likely to have more difficult assignments. If you're not taking an honor or AP class, it's less likely you're going to be given summer projects. Kids could tend do be less interested due to amount or difficulty they're given. What's the hardest assignment your teachers given you?

The real question is, how could we persuade school districts to allow these types of learning assignments? My school's county has social media accounts such as,

Instagram and Twitter, that will inform parents, faculty, staff, and students, important messages about our community. If your school has a social media account, try to contact them or research your suggestion, so you could to see if your idea could even be possible. Getting a message back from a school social media account, can be harder than finding the answers you were looking for online. You could always ask a teacher, guidance councilor, or anyone at your school, to help you with any of your issues, including learning suggestions. If I was in this position, I would tweet at my county's Twitter or direct message them, to try to get the answers I'm looking for.

At last, it's 2020, and our goal on easier summer projects, hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. We have self-driving cars and miniature robots to plan, remind, and clean for ourselves; but, we can't make school work more comfortable for summer. If we want to show our country that there's an easier way to prepare ourselves for school, we need to create an impressive thought out plan. We can figure out our main idea and focusing points, to later show our school counties all over the country, how important this subject is. Students just want a more relaxing and entertaining way to learn over their summer vacation, so why aren't we doing it?",0
"Dear Principal:

Word on the street is that you're considering banning cell phones from school campus. Now, you know as well as I do that the students are NOT happy about this at all. But I'm sure that that alone is not enough to convince you to let our cell phones be. That's why I'm writing to you about a policy that will allow cell phones on school ground, with a few limits, that will satisfy everyone.

First off, let me tell you why banning cell phones altogether is a bad idea. The students will be infuriated if that idea is put into motion, and will not only defy the rule, but a handful of students might actually do worse things, such as texting in class. You see, if you take away something from the students, they'll not only continue bringing that said something, they will, just to show that they don't care what the school administration does, do worse things. It's just the way students my age are, and I'm sure the younger grades are just the same way.

Plus, a lot of us actually need cell phones; many students are part of after-school programs or clubs, and they need to call their parents to gain permission to stay. In fact, a lot of students know when and when not to use their phones, and go along with it. It's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule of using cellular devices during class. The rest of us know the rules and why it exists and respect that. The rest of us want to learn, and do learn.

Now, I propose an alternative to the ""no phone"" policy you are considering: let us keep our phones, but don't let us use them in inappropriate times, like in class. Let us continue bringing cell phones to school on the condition that we don't use them unless needed. I'm sure that we will be mature about this and honor your decision if you choose this rule. I promise you that if there are students that can't be grateful for the merciful decision you made, those will be minimal and can be dealt easily with ninth hour or lunch detention.

In conclusion, I thank you for your time in reading this letter, and I'm sure you'll choose the better option. Remember, it's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule.

Thanks for reading,

"I think it is very valuable because it knows if you're happy or sad which helps in a lot of ways. Another interesting example would be ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""and the technology is so good it can make computer animated faces more expressive according to the text and can too for surgery videos. And the computer may not detect your emotional communication but noted Dr. Huang said ""so computers need to understand that too.

""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and all 44 important muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""it also says that we may sometimes not really know what is wrong with our friends, and sometimes we can because of their facial expression. Or just behavior in general but sometimes they don't want to show that emotion or what is in them the computer can detect all of that.

So I personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldn't really express there selves to the class as if they were with their friends. So all we would have to do is just by a single glimpse on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happened. And she doesn't really know what to do so she seeks help from a counselor, and she just checks what is going on with her and just by that maybe her whole life could change by checking the computer. Tech is advancing a lot and is helping the Socrata positively and yet negatively but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but motive stuff.",0
"Dear Principal

I think to make the school system better that community service is a good idea to do because. The students learn more about staying out of trouble. Because when you are in trouble u see that u will steal have work to no matter what because staying is not a good thing, so they show you by making you do community service. And maybe that will show you how to stay out of trouble and some people in joy doing community service because it makes them feel better about. Helping other and just cleaning is always helpful to your community to show how you care, and you want things to look better to show that you have a great community, and you like keeping it clean, and you would like others in your community to do the same to show that you care. Then if the community is clean maybe new people will come and like what they see about your community and would like to move in. So yes to me community service is a good idea.",0
"The stability of a society is determined by various factors, including economic stability, political stability, social stability, and cultural stability. However, one of the critical factors that can affect the sustainability of a society is how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that the stability of a society depends on how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my answer.

Firstly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can determine how well it can maintain law and order. In any society, there will always be individuals who may exhibit deviant behavior that can threaten the peace and stability of that society. These behaviors include acts of violence, terrorism, theft, and other forms of criminal activities. The response of the society to these behaviors will determine whether they will continue or not. For example, if a society responds to these behaviors by increasing security measures, punishing offenders, and rehabilitating them, then it will be able to maintain law and order. However, if the society responds to these behaviors with indifference, then it may lead to an increase in such behaviors, which can destabilize the society.

Secondly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can affect the mental and emotional well-being of its citizens. When individuals engage in extreme behaviors, they not only harm themselves but also harm the people around them. This can lead to fear, anxiety, and trauma, which can affect the mental and emotional well-being of the society. The response of the society to these behaviors can either help individuals heal or make them feel more traumatized. For example, if a society responds to an act of terrorism by offering counseling services to the victims and their families, it can help them heal from the trauma. However, if the society responds with hostility and aggression, it can make the situation worse, leading to more trauma.

Thirdly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can affect its reputation and image. In today's globalized world, the reputation of a society plays a significant role in attracting tourists, investors, and other forms of economic activities. If a society is known for its tolerance and ability to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors, it will attract more people and investments. However, if a society is known for its intolerance and inability to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors, it will drive away people and investments. For example, after the 9/11 attacks in the USA, the response of the society was to increase security measures, punish the offenders, and offer support to the victims and their families. This response helped to restore the reputation of the USA as a tolerant and resilient society.

In conclusion, the stability of a society depends on how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. The response of a society can affect its ability to maintain law and order, the mental and emotional well-being of its citizens, and it's reputation and image. Therefore, it is essential for societies to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors to ensure their sustainability. The appropriate response should be one that promotes healing, tolerance, and resilience rather than hostility and aggression.",1
"The use of E-dictionaries has become increasingly popular among students today, leading to discussions about its merits and demerits in aiding English learning. Although E-dictionaries provide a convenient and quick way to look up words and check the spelling, I agree with the opinion that it's overuse may have more drawbacks than benefits for English learning.

For one thing, relying too much on E-dictionaries may undermine the motivation to learn English vocabulary. Many E-dictionaries provide the function of translating words and phrases into different languages, which may make it less necessary for students to learn the English words and phrases. This can result in the diminishing of their enthusiasm and motivation in learning English. Moreover, since the translation provided by some E-dictionaries is not always accurate, using them as the only reference may lead to misunderstandings and lead to confusion in the learning process.

Furthermore, overreliance on E-dictionaries may diminish our spelling ability. While it is true that E-dictionaries provide an effective way to check the spelling of words, constant use of the function can lead to over-dependence on it, making students lose confidence in their ability to spell correctly. This, in turn, may cause them to become reluctant in attempting to learn English independently and take more risks in their exploration of the language.

In conclusion, I agree with the opinion that the overuse of E-dictionaries may have more drawbacks than advantages for English learning. Therefore, I believe that English teachers should encourage students to find a balance between the use of E-dictionaries and independent learning and exploration of English.

"Dear State senator, A lot of chatter about weather the president should be elected by electoral college or by popular vote is going around my school for the past couple of weeks, and I can't help but to give my own opinion about this argument. I believe that the popular vote should decide who is the president.

I believe this because of two reasons. One, the citizens are the ones that are going to have to deal with this good or bad president for four years and possibly eight years. Also, the state senators can be bribed by one or the other candidates running for president. This candidate could have the worst plans for the next four years and all because he cheated to win. This could cause riots and prawns around the United States.

Two, Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. What this means is that candidates are not going to focus on the States that they know they won't get any votes from. For example in source TW, during the campaign of 2000, seventeen states were not visited by either candidates, so they didn't get to see any campaign ads. This is unfair because it makes it harder, almost impossible for these states to choose on who to vote for because they had no presentations to choose from. This puts too much power in the candidates hands.

Some may believe otherwise. For example, since the Electoral votes are from very experienced people that have put there life and time into knowing about what is right and wrong. They are much more experience than the normal citizens. Also, Electoral College prevents runoff elections to occur. For example in source three, the electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This causes lots of pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner.

In my own opinion the one that decided the winner is popular votes. There can still be Elector Collage votes, but the Electoral votes have too much power and is unfair to the citizens of the United States.",0
"The idea of an entire area having no car owners sounds a little strange to someone living in a big city. Especially a suburban area with no cars, but in places like Vauban, Bogota and even Paris have revolutionized the idea of transportation.

Vauban, Germany-is a suburban area where 70 percent of the families that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only a couple places to park such as large parking garages at the edge of the development where you can buy a parking space for 40,000, and with the purchase of a home. Residents of Vauban such as Hadron Walter, mother of two children says when she owned a car she was always tense and that she is much happier without a car. Vauban is home to 5,500 residents and may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.

Paris, France nearly hit the record for highest polluted city in the world, until they banned the citizens from driving to clear the air of the global city. People who had an even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is $31 in America, the same applied to the odd-numbered plates the following day. Approximately 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in Paris. After 5 days of intensifying smog rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed for the mass pollution, Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban or odd-numbered plates.

In Bogotá, Colombia there is a program that is set to spread to other countries, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work for a car-free day, leaving the large capital city devoid of traffic jams. The goal of this car-free day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, the turnout was successful. Citizens of Bogotá like Carlos Arturo Plaza says it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. For the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. Higher authorities from other countries came to Bogotá to see the event. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" said Enrique Rear, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. Car-free day started in the mid-1990's and as created the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city.

Getting out of your car and taking a walk for a couple miles is something you should consider doing every day. Walking has an insane amount of advantages, it can even save your life. The amount of pollution in the world is doing nothing but rising and the best way to avoid it getting any worse is reducing the amount of driving we do every day.",0
"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on individual experiences and preferences. However, in general, young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people are.

There are several reasons for this. Firstly, young people are typically more optimistic and enthusiastic about life than older people are. They are more likely to see the positive aspects of life and to be excited about the future. Secondly, young people are typically more active and energetic than older people are. They are more likely to enjoy physical activities and to be social. Thirdly, young people are typically more open-minded and tolerant than older people are. They are more likely to be interested in different cultures and to be accepting of different people.

All of these factors contribute to the fact that young people generally enjoy life more than older people do. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, and some older people are very active and enthusiastic about life. However, in general, young people are more likely to find joy in life than older people are.

"Character traits are essential tools in determining who we are and how we interact with the world around us. Whether we are consciously choosing our characteristics or they have been molded by our environment, our traits have the potential to profoundly shape our lives.

When individuals take on the task of examining their traits and actively choosing which ones to foster or abandon, they are engaging in the practice of self-development. Being aware and mindful of the qualities that define us and the consequences they may have, allows us to take control of our lives and create our own destiny. These actions can lead to greater autonomy, happiness, and satisfaction with our decisions, as we are empowering ourselves instead of allowing ourselves to be a product of external forces.

On the other hand, when character traits are acquired due to outside circumstances, we are left in a vulnerable state, as we are not in control of the messages conveyed by our traits. Depending on our upbringing, peer group, or societal norms, the traits that form us can be limiting and inhibit us from reaching our desired goals. If we do not question and challenge what has been instilled in us, we may become victim to our own preconceived beliefs and succumb to our environment’s restrictions.

Therefore, it is important for us to become mindful of our character traits, as they play an integral role in determining the direction of our lives. Self-development and intentional self-growth can grant us the freedom to pursue our passions and find fulfillment in our lives.",1
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that policy number two is a great policy.

I think this because if students are allowed to have phones it would be a distraction.

First this a good policy because without phones in school it would let students concentrate. Also, because students would be able to do there work without using their phone. This policy would let the students get good grades on their test. Students have the rest of the day after school to use there phone and text. This policy is also great because without having phones it would make this school a better one because it would show that the teachers want the students to do good and have a great future. There are many more great reasons why students should not be allowed to have phones during school. In conclusion that is some reasons why students should not be allowed to have phones during school hours.",0
"Dear Principle,

I have come to notice that our school might be going to do community service projects. I applaud you in the fact you are showing the littler kids that working for your community is a good thing. But it has also come to my attention that are a few students that would rather not do community service because it takes away from there time to do what they like to do. TEACHER_NAME I have found a way that can fix this problem. I propose that we set a day that students can do community service in school.

For example on every third and fourth Wednesday we could set out forty minutes of class time for community service, like tutoring kids. Kids tutoring other kids is a great community service because it helps the student get better grades and will help the school for Fact. Another project we can do is a fun day with the students at the local special needs school. We can have a day were about twenty kids are selected by there grade average to go to the school and have a fun day, with a movie and popcorn, and just a day we could hang out together. TEACHER_NAME as you see these are only some community projects we can do, that is also reason to do this in our school because there are so many options the school could use for community service.

Another reason we should have community service is because it can change people. I believe that sometimes doing one good thing, for someone else, can change someone. So if we have community service some unruly kids could go to a soup kitchen and see that they don't have it that bad and there is no reason to act this way without a pretty good reason or bring them to a detention center and allow them to talk to the kids, and give a small tutoring lesson since they are out of school for a while, and maybe seeing these kids will allow them to see what there doing and change.

The last most important reason I think we should have community service is that in the future the student will have to have it to graduate, so you would be setting them on the path to success.

Thank you and I hope you take this into consideration.

Thank You again.

"Dear Principal,

I think that making students have at least a b average in their classes is wrong. My reasoning for this statement is that most student have trouble getting at least a c average let alone a b average. If you were going to do this there would be a lot less people participating in extracurricular activities therefore less money for your school. Most of the kids participating in your extracurricular activities are jocks not geniuses. There would be a lot of people protesting this issue because without sports and other extracurricular activities a lot of the kids would have not made the friends they have today. These activities are not only about the competition it's about having fun. The schools are trying to promote a healthier lifestyle but without sports the kids would be less active and therefore there would be an increase in the obesity rates. Sports should be a healthy way to be more active not a way to make students spend hours a night studding. If u were to do this you might as well have no extracurricular activities at all because they wouldn't be enough students participating in them. I think the policy should stay the same not make it harder to have a social life. I personally hate the idea of this because school would be less fun without these activities to participate in. Most kids don't like school to begin with so this policy would just make it worse and make more high school drop-outs. These activities are the only way some people are going to get to go to college. In today's tough economy less and fewer students can afford college, so they need the athletic scholarships. You don't want to ruin the students' education, do you? Exactly you're trying to help them not put them down. The educational directors are supposed to promote it not make them not want to even attempt to go to college. Therefore, the policy should stay the same because of all the reasons stated in this letter and on behalf of the students, so thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to read this letter.

"School days can be a drag at times, and can cause a lack of interest and become unmotivated in school. Then at the end of every school day, most of us go home to relax from the day we went through, but sometimes going home to the same old routine can become boring. However, the principal announcing that every student should take an extracurricular activity sounds like a great solution to this, because these activities will allow students to interact with others, introduce students to be able to learn new skill sets, and give students a chance to participate in activities they love.

One reason that the principal's decision is a good idea is because this will allow students to interact with each other more often. Sure, we do that every day during school, but if you were to join a club or group, it would be a great opportunity to make new friends. Since you would be choosing a group based on your interests instead of attending a common subject, this would mean that others in your group would share the same interests as you, which is great for connecting with others. For example, when I was in a little soccer league, I was able to talk and play with others while knowing that they liked the same things that I did, which made me feel included and a part of the team. Being able to interact with others also allow for the improvement of social and teamwork skills. Playing in a sport is a good example of this because of how teammates cooperate with each other to reach their goal and win the game. It can be fun during games when you pass the ball to each other before shooting a goal, making the whole team know that they all made a big contribution during the game.

Another reason that having a required extracurricular is a good idea is how they can give students a chance to find new hobbies and skills. Whatever extracurricular you choose can introduce you to a skill set based off your liking. Say if someone were interested technology, computers, robots and such. They could join a coding or engineering club, which could become a new hobby for themselves. This can also apply to choosing activities out of someone's comfort zone. Students that choose to join groups out of their average liking can lead to the development of a new hobby that they never knew they had. Once when I had to stay after school to attend a concert, so I had to take an activity in the meantime. One of the few choices available was a social study group, which I needed at the time. It turned out to be a pleasant experience while working with others. Gaining new hobbies from extracurricular activities can also skills to help students find what they're going to do in the future. Like if someone were interested in wildlife or animals. That person could join a wildlife conservation group or an awareness group of some sort, so they could be involved with the thing they love and be introduced to a new skill that can also be beneficial in their community and even in their future.

A third reason for why required extracurricular activities are a good idea is that they can allow students to enjoy themselves. Students know how it feels to have to lag through every school day, as well as having to worry about their grades and piling school work. Being in an extracurricular can take your mind off of school in the moments you're in that group, and let you enjoy the time you spend there instead of having to stress yourself out more than you can handle. And, as previously stated, you'll be able to spend time with other students who know what it's like to face unmotivated times in school, home, or any other place. They can all talk to each other and do what interests them while even learning about topics without having piles of work to do afterwards, like in a coding club. And you'll be able to relax more often, or at the very least do what you think is fun. Like make arts and crafts, make or play games, play a sport, help the environment. Whatever you enjoy doing, there's most likely a club just for that. Something that you and any other student can enjoy.

Having to take a required extracurricular activity doesn't seem as bad when you think about it. You're able to be with and connect with others, discover new activities that you didn't even know you would enjoy, and take your mind off of the stressful events going on and enjoy yourself. So if you like the sound of that, then having an extracurricular seems like a great idea that you can give a chance.",0
"Dear,

Principle

I think that the students should be allowed to use there cell phones during free time. It is not like they are going to cheat on a test because they are at lunch. But I also think that they really don't need them unless they have to text their parents. They really don't need them because they are at school with all of their friends so who do they need to text because all there friends are with them. Before the students go into class they should have to drop their phones into a bin, so they do not get tempted to text during class. When they have free time they should be able to use them because after all it is free time. They should also be able to use them at lunch because they might need to text there parents or a friend to tell them what time to pick them up or to bring them lunch because they forgot theirs. The second rule about not letting students have a cell phone at school at all is a bad idea to me. They should be able to use there phone because they might need them, and they are the same as going on a computer at lunch because you can still email people and go on the internet. So why should you not be able to use cell phones if you can use computers. I think that you should pass the first policy instead of the second because all the students would enjoy being able to use them at lunch.",0
"University education has been a topic of debate for many years, with some people believing that the primary purpose of a university education is to prepare students for employment, while others believe that it has other functions. In my opinion, while preparing students for employment is one of the primary functions of university education, it is not the only function.

To begin with, university education helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. These skills are not only essential for success in the workplace but also in everyday life. For example, university students are required to analyze and evaluate complex information from various sources and make informed decisions. These skills are not only beneficial in the workplace but also in personal and social situations.

Moreover, university education provides students with the opportunity to explore their interests and passions. Students can choose from a wide range of courses and majors, allowing them to pursue their interests and discover new ones. This exploration of interests and passions can lead to personal growth and self-discovery, which is equally important to employment.

Furthermore, university education provides students with the opportunity to engage in research and community service. These activities not only benefit society but also help students develop skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. These skills are highly valued in the workplace and can increase a student's employability.

However, it is undeniable that preparing students for employment is also an important function of university education. Universities provide students with the knowledge and skills required for their chosen profession. Many universities also offer career services, internships, and job placement assistance to help students transition into the workforce.

In conclusion, while preparing students for employment is an important function of university education, it is not the only function. University education provides students with critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, the opportunity to explore their interests and passions, and the chance to engage in research and community service. These functions are equally important to a student's personal and professional growth.

"Driving into the Future

What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self-driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheral vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that process situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and eliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.

Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can process situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival time. Smart cars, as the leading industries call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintain eyes on the road. These cars are maintain a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.

While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safely navigate out of it and override the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.

With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars' people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.

Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, driving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel. I would certainly choose the computer driving me, my friends and coworkers around for my safety and theirs.",0
" Four-Day School: A Debate between Benefits and Disadvantages

The debate surrounding the adoption of a four-day school week has been gaining traction in recent years, with many businesses and educational institutions considering the option. While there are certainly advantages to having a shorter school week, there are also potential drawbacks that must be carefully considered before making a decision. In this essay, we will examine the benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week and explore possible solutions to mitigate any negative consequences.

One of the main benefits of a four-day school week is the potential for increased productivity and focus during class time. By reducing the number of school days, students would have more time to devote to their studies and complete assignments more efficiently. Additionally, having an extra day off each week could provide students with the opportunity to catch up on any missed work or seek additional help from teachers or tutors.

Another potential advantage of a four-day school week is the opportunity for students to engage in extracurricular activities or pursue hobbies outside of school. With an extra day off each week, students could have more time to pursue their interests and develop new skills. This could lead to increased creativity, motivation, and overall well-being.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to a four-day school week that must be considered. One potential disadvantage is the potential for reduced attendance and academic performance. If students are not attending school on the fifth day, they may be missing out on important information or falling behind on their coursework. Additionally, teachers may struggle to keep up with the increased workload of teaching for fewer days each week.

Another potential disadvantage of a four-day school week is the potential for increased stress and burnout for both students and teachers. With fewer days off each week, students and teachers may feel more pressure to complete their work and may struggle to find time for rest and relaxation. This could lead to increased stress levels and decreased overall well-being.

To mitigate these potential drawbacks, there are several possible solutions that could be implemented. One option is to extend the school day by two hours each day, which would provide students with more time to complete their work and engage in extracurricular activities. Additionally, schools could offer additional resources or support for students who may be struggling to keep up with their coursework, such",1
"""No one cares about the environment."" said no one ever. The environment we live in, whether it's a crowded city like New York, or Paris, or even a regular suburban community, is a wonderful place. There is one issue though that has spread among communities, and that is the high amount of car usage. Having a car and being able to track to great distances in a short amount of time is great, but look at what cars do to the environment. Also, when it comes to buying a car, you're basically throwing your bank account out the window. And don't get me started with the worries of having your children play in the streets.

Now, let's discuss the crazy amount of money you have to throw away on a car. You either throw away a fortune on a good car, that runs good, and then end up taking years to pay it off, or you buy a cheap, beat up car, that is always in need of repair. Either way it is a loose, lose situation. Why buy these insanely priced cars when you can buy a nice bike that moves perfectly. At around five hundred dollars, to a thousand dollars a bike is easily the way to go. A bonus to buying a nice bike instead of a car, is that while you ride your bike, you'll get into shape in no time at all. Now if you need to track a great distance that riding a bike can not get you to fast enough, buses or mobile transport have bike racks on them, so you can ride a bus to the nearest position to where you need to be then simply ride your bike for the remainder of the distance.

The main issue here with cars for most people, is that there is a large amount of pollution that comes with driving a car. In Paris the pollution from cars were so bad that Paris had to put a temporary ban on driving to help clear out all the smog that was in the sky. Also, in America car pollution is the second-largest source of pollution emissions. There is no other way to say it, cars make up a lot of the earths' pollution, and when the time comes that people start to die down on using cars the world will be a much healthier place to be in.

Now you can not tell me that there is not at least one parent who will read this next statement and not agree more. Fewer cars, safer streets. Every mom, dad, brother, sister, or any kind of other relative have worried about their family playing in the streets. There are millions of accidents every year in the world that result in people getting hit by cars and killed, or seriously injured. With fewer cars on the streets the world will be a much safer place for kids, and even adults, as there is drunk drivers you have to look out for, or reckless drivers who don't even have a license.

All together limiting car usage will have multiple benefits to the world, and even your own community. One being you don't have to pay for a car when they start going out of style, another being the worlds' pollution will lower at a huge rate, and last that the roads we live, and breathe on will be a much safer place. Limit your car usage and make the word a better place on step at a time.  ",0
"Some of the advantages we get from limiting the uses of cars are, we make cities denser, and safer and better to walk. Without cars people could walk the streets and not have to worry about someone running into them, or they wouldn't have to pay attention to their kids as much as we do today. If we didn't use cars today, we would have less drinking and driving accidents cause if u didn't have a vehicle u wouldn't be able to drive drunk. In the passage hadron Walter said they were happier without a vehicle when they had a vehicle they were always tense 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there vehicles, so they could move.

Cars today have mufflers that blow out smoke to pollute the air Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If u drove any vehicle in Paris the officers would stop u and u would get a fine for 31 dollars. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people had there vehicles impounded just because of there reaction the fine that they were given. Congestion was down to 60 percent in France they had to suffer 5 days of smog china and Beijing was the number one polluted cities in the world. Deisel was the blame for 67 percent of pollution in France.

Paris has more smog than other cities Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79 in London. On the third straight year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis for 7 million people. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If u didn't obey the rules violators were faced with a 25 dollar fine. Soon California and Valledupar joined the no car event. When the countries came to see about the event ta were enthusiastic these people are generating a revolutionary Chang and this is crossing borders said Enrique rear.

Ameria has been rapidly dropping the rat of driving the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily in 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January in 1995. Since transportation is the second-largest source of Americas emissions just behind the power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Companys like ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves mobility companies with a broader product range end the personal vehicle.

New York has an Ike sharing program, and it is skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation. A stud show that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.",0
"Some people think that taking classes from home is an easy way to study without having to leave home. While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work, not everyone has access to internet, teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.

One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would not be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus on what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.

Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seem good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have an internet source. There could be paces where getting good

Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue has people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.

One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than through the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person. People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.

Meanwhile, people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from is not away a good idea because students would not be inspired, not everyone has access to internet, and teachers would help students more in person. With all said we can conclude that the best way to study is by attending to school and no from home.",0
"The advent of social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information. With a few clicks, we can connect with friends and family from around the world, share our thoughts and experiences, and stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends. However, this increased connectivity has come with a cost: the loss of privacy. As a result, there is a growing need for stronger privacy protections on social media platforms.

On one hand, proponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. This includes everything from basic contact information to more sensitive data such as credit card numbers and medical records. Without adequate safeguards in place, this information could be accessed by hackers, identity thieves, and other malicious actors, putting users at risk of financial fraud or even physical harm.

Furthermore, social media platforms often collect and use personal data for targeted advertising purposes. While this can be beneficial for both users and advertisers, it raises concerns about the potential for abuse. For example, if a user's data is used to target them with political ads, they may be more susceptible to manipulation or misinformation. In some cases, this could even undermine the integrity of democratic processes.

On the other hand, opponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media users should be responsible for managing their own privacy settings and sharing only the information they are comfortable with. They argue that users have the freedom to choose which platforms they use and how much personal information they share, and that it is not the responsibility of social media companies to police this behavior.

Additionally, some argue that stronger privacy protections could stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of social media. For example, if social media companies are required to obtain explicit consent before collecting or using personal data, they may be less able to develop new features or services that rely on this data.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that stronger privacy protections are needed on social media platforms. The potential risks of data breaches and misuse are simply too great to ignore, and social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. At the same time, users should also take steps to manage their own privacy settings and be mindful of the information they share online. By working together, we can create a safer and more secure social media environment for all.",1
"Driverless Cars is a great idea, these cars would make a huge change in the world because these cars would be really helpful, but there are some advantages and disavenges of the use of these cars, one advantages is that can drive by themselves, but a disadvantage is that if the sensors don't work what would happen?.

Driverless cars would be really helpful for people and mostly for people that travel a lot they fall sleep, these cars would help them by taking control and so no one get hurt. Driverless cars have sensors that help to create a 3-D model of the car's surroundings, so this would help the car to see if there is any danger and if the is the car will notify the driver to take over and take another options. Cars like these are a great idea, it will allow the drivers to take a rest when they are tired.

Cars like driverless cars are not perfect, and they are not 100 percent safe, these cars can be really expensive too and not everyone would buy them. About safety the sensors that these cars use what if they don't work? What would it happen? If the sensors don't work the cars will not alert the driver if there is any danger and this will end up in an accident and would not be good for the manufacturer and the owner, these were some reasons why the manufacturers want to put cameras in the cars, so the car can see the driver and know whether the driver can drive or cannot drive.

Some manufacturers like GM they have developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Other car that tells the driver when they should take over the car is the Google car. Cameras in cars can help a lot because while the driver is watching the road the car is watching the driver. Some manufacturers are considering bringing entertainment for these cars and information system that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver needs to take over. This new technology in cars is perfect, but how much these will cost? No one knows yet. I strongly agree with to develop of the driverless cars because this will really help people and will help to reduce the cars accidents.

Driverless cars are definitely are great this new technology will allow the driver to take a rest and then take over any time. The sensors that the cars have help to avoid any danger. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have these new cars drive themselves by 2020, the cars they try to make will be the best option to have fewer cars accidents in the future.",0
"I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I think that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today.

There are a few reasons why I think this will be the case. First, the population is growing. More people means more cars. Second, the population is getting older. Older people are more likely to own a car than younger people. Third, cars are becoming more affordable. More people can afford to buy a car than ever before.

There are a few reasons why cars might become less popular in twenty years. First, the cost of owning a car is rising. Cars are becoming more expensive to maintain and to fuel. Second, alternative modes of transportation are becoming more popular. People are choosing to bike or walk more often than they used to. Third, self-driving cars are becoming more common. This could lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road.

Despite these potential factors, I think that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today. The population is growing, the population is getting older, and cars are becoming more affordable. These factors will outweigh the potential factors that could lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road.

"The reason why there is the technology of people to know how to understand on how the reason the pot rites are in this world today. By showing on how the way the pictures in the text is showing how she is smiling. I think we should leave her face the way is originally on the way it is from the way the marginal person painted it. It is being very respectful on how the painting is being displayed in different muse mes here around the world.

The reason why I think this is that let's say that we painted something and someone goes in and paint it completely different. Then what you made it to be in the first place. So I feel like we all should leave things they were when they were created. The respect we give we get in return from the same reason y we gave it to others because the more you give, the more it looks good on you in the long run. So just remember that the next time you see someone changing someone else's painting or others works. They work so hard on because why would they work so hard on something that someone else is just going to go back in and change it.  ",0
" Summer vacations are an essential break for students to recharge and refresh their minds. It is an opportunity for them to spend time with their families, take a break from school, and engage in activities that they enjoy. However, some educators believe that summer vacations should be shorter, and students should be required to attend school year-round. In this essay, I will argue that summer vacations should be longer and that reducing them would have negative consequences for students' mental and emotional well-being.

First, summer vacations provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation. School can be stressful, and students often feel overwhelmed with work and responsibilities. Summer vacation offers a chance for students to unwind and recharge. This is especially important for students who have experienced bullying, stress, or academic failure. They need time to process their emotions and reflect on their experiences. Reducing summer vacation would mean that these students would not have the opportunity to take a break and focus on their mental health.

Second, summer vacations allow students to pursue their interests and hobbies. Many students use their summer vacation to take up new activities or pursue their passions. This can be an excellent opportunity for them to learn new skills and develop their talents. Reducing summer vacation would mean that students would not have the time to engage in these activities, and their personal growth would be stunted.

Third, summer vacations provide students with the opportunity to work and earn money. Many students use their summer vacation to get a job and save money for college or other expenses. This can be an excellent way for them to gain work experience and develop valuable skills. Reducing summer vacation would mean that students would not have the opportunity to work and earn money, and their financial stability would be compromised.

In conclusion, summer vacations are an essential part of the educational experience. They provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation, allow them to pursue their interests and hobbies, and provide them with the opportunity to work and earn money. Reducing summer vacation would have negative consequences for students' mental and emotional well-being, personal growth, and financial stability. Therefore, it is crucial that educators and policymakers recognize the importance of summer vacations and work to ensure that they are long enough to provide students with the benefits they need.",1
"Hey, so I'm going to write this essay about how having a good attitude can be super important, even when things are tough. Like, I know it can be easy to get down when stuff isn't going your way, but if you have a good attitude, it can make all the difference.

First, having a good attitude can make you successful. Like, if you're always positive and stuff, people are gonna want to be around you and stuff. They're gonna wanna work with you and stuff, 'cause you're going to be fun to be around. And that means you're going to have more opportunities, 'cause people are gonna want to help you out and stuff. And that's how you get ahead in life, right?

And it's not just about getting ahead, it's also about being strong. When things are tough, if you have a good attitude, you can handle it. You can be like, ""Yeah, this is tough, but I can do it."" And then you can do it, 'cause you believe in yourself. And that's when you're at your strongest, when you're like, ""I can handle anything.""

And it's not just about you, it's also about how you can help others. When you have a good attitude, you're more likely to help people out, 'cause you're in a good mood and stuff. And that's when you can make a difference in people's lives, 'cause you're being nice and stuff. And that's when you can make a real impact, 'cause you're not just thinking about yourself, you're thinking about others too.

And let me tell you, it's not just like, ""Oh, good attitudes are nice and stuff."" It's like, they can lead to amazing experiences. Like, if you have a good attitude, you're more likely to take risks and stuff, and that's when you can have the most fun. And that's when you can have the best experiences, 'cause you're not just stuck in one place, you're out there doing stuff and living life.

So, like, let me give",1
"This Facial Action Coding System could be good in a couple ways but it's unnecessary. Computers might know what your emotions and help in a couple ways to know if you're confused about something or do not like something you see on the internet. Just because you look at someone's face, it doesn't mean that they feel some type of way. Someone could be smiling or laughing, but that doesn't mean that they are truly happy. It's the same thing by having a serious face.

A face expression doesn't always show someone's emotions. Other people do not care about other people's emotions. It's better to notice things with your own eyes than a computer or machine to tell you how somebody is ""feeling"". The article says you can tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. That's true because you know that person very well.

People do want to hide their emotions for their own specific reason. We all have that moment when we would want to keep our feelings to ourselves. We wouldn't like for systems to know our emotions.",0
" I believe that having a positive attitude is essential in life. In my experience, maintaining a positive outlook has helped me achieve many of my goals and enjoy the good things that come my way. I have learned to always look on the bright side, even in difficult situations, and to be grateful for what I have. This has helped me to attract positive energy and opportunities into my life.

One of the benefits of having a positive attitude is that it allows you to give advice and support to others. When you approach people with a positive attitude, they are more likely to respond in kind. This can lead to a cycle of positivity and support, where both parties feel uplifted and motivated.

It's also important to remember that life is unpredictable, and that sometimes things may not go as planned. However, instead of dwelling on the negatives, it's important to focus on the present moment and make the most of the situation. This can help you find new opportunities and learn from your mistakes.

Overall, I believe that having a positive attitude is key to living a fulfilling and successful life. By focusing on the positive, you can attract good things into your life and make a difference in the lives of those around you.",1
"On that faithful June afternoon, the school bell rings for its last time in three months. Students rush out of their classes and greet the summer with open arms. Of course, once school opens up again in August, many of these students have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Many schools assign projects to complete over the summer in order to keep their students' minds sharp; however, there are debates whether the teachers or the students should design the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed, so students can properly develop the tools that will help them succeed the following year.

Teacher-designed projects will set the rigor of the class, so students know what to expect. It is most likely that the teacher that assigns the project will be the one instructing the class. If teachers design the project, they can set the guidelines for the year in their summer assignment, so students are not caught off guard. This is especially important for higher level classes such as honors or AP; it is best that all students are aware of the class' expectations, so they can develop their skills as necessary for the course. Students can also decide whether the class is right for them, whether it be because it is too rigorous, not rigorous enough, or simply because the subject does not interest them. This way there is less fuss during the school year as students try to switch their classes.

Teacher-designed projects can allow the students to grow their academic independence. During the school year, teachers are readily available in case students need to answer questions. However, during the summer it is not as easy as raising one's hand in class; students are almost entirely on their own. They will have to develop the skills needed to solve a novel problem independently. This ability is referred to by psychologists as fluid intelligence. One's fluid intelligence decreases with age, so it is important for students to strengthen it while they are young. Students may also find useful academic tools that help them to understand the material of the class. One of the more well known of these tools is Khan Academy. Students often go to these websites to understand what they could not in class. Finding these tools during the summer will prove useful, as they can still be used during the school year.

While student input is important, the teachers are more likely to give projects that are closer in rigor and content to the actual class. Teachers have been trained both in teaching that the subject that they teach, so they likely know the best way to prepare students for what lies ahead. This is why summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students.",0
"Community service is a hot topic in schools these days, with many schools requiring students to complete a certain number of hours of community service in order to graduate. While some people think this is a great way to teach students the value of giving back to their community, others argue that it takes away from the time students could be spending on academics. In this essay, I'll explore the pros and cons of requiring community service, and suggest a potential solution that takes into account the needs of all parties involved.

One of the biggest pros of requiring community service is that it teaches students important life skills, such as empathy, teamwork, and problem-solving. By giving students the opportunity to help others, they learn how to work together towards a common goal and develop a sense of social responsibility. Additionally, community service can help students develop a sense of purpose and direction, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling with academic or personal issues.

On the other hand, some people argue that requiring community service takes away from the time students could be spending on academics. This is a valid concern, as students who are required to complete many community service hours may fall behind in their schoolwork or struggle to keep up with their academic responsibilities. Additionally, some students may not have access to community service opportunities, either because they live in areas with limited options or because they have other commitments such as work or family responsibilities.

So, what's the solution? One potential solution is to require community service, but to also provide students with flexible options that can be tailored to their individual needs. For example, students could be allowed to choose from a variety of community service projects, such as volunteering at a local animal shelter, participating in a beach cleanup, or helping out at a food bank. This way, students can choose an activity that they are passionate about and that fits their schedule and interests.

Another potential solution is to provide students with academic credit for their community service hours. This way, students can earn credits towards their graduation requirements while still fulfilling their community service obligations. This could be especially helpful for students who are struggling to balance their academic and community service responsibilities.

In conclusion, while there are both pros and cons to requiring community service, a potential solution is to provide students with flexible",1
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does not do a good job of supporting their idea. The author believes that, while Venus is dangerous it is worthy of spending time and money to explore this planet. The author mentions the similarities between earth and Venus, makes exploring this planet so fascinating. The author later goes on to explain how NASA would travel and explore Venus, and what tools they would use to explore Venus. How NASA would travel to Venus is reevaluate to if Venus is worth exploring. Because, the author spends a majority of their time telling us how, NASA would learn more about Venus. Is not needed to prove and explain why exploring Venus is pessary.

The author spends three of their six body paragraphs explaining how NASA would explore the planet of Venus. In paragraph 6 they explain that sending an orbiting ship around the planet will provide limited insight of the ground below, and the only way to gain more knowledge is to be able to collect rock and gas samples. The author never states what we could possible learn from the rock samples, or even celebrates on the idea of collecting a variety of samples from the planet. They later spend paragraph 7 explaining the history of computers and how much computes have progressed since 1800. They even explain the mechanics of computers during the World War II for example, ""these devices make calculations by using gear and levers and do not require electronics at all."" The mechanics of computers has nothing to do with the idea that we should be exploring NASA. The information provided in paragraph 5 through 7, such as the history and mechanics of computers. The little information given on how a rock sample will help us learn about Venus, or that NASA isn't able to gain enough information from sending a hovering ship about the planet, do not help or support the authors claim that Venus is worthy of exploring despite the dangers.

To summarize, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

Does not do a good job of explaining why Venus is worthy is studying and exploring, despite the dangers. The author spends too much time explaining computers, the history and the mechanics of them, and what we could learn about Venus through computers. They also use their time to tell their readers that sending an orbiting ship around plant won't provide us with enough information, and to explain how they would explore Venus and the tools they would use. The author did a poor job of explaining the importance of exploring Venus despite the dangers.",0
"Title: The Joy of Swimming

Hey there, it's me, [Your Name], an average 8th grader, here to share my thoughts on why swimming is an enjoyable activity. I know, I know, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but trust me, it should be! 😊

First off, let's talk about the benefits of swimming. It's a full-body workout that can improve your cardiovascular health, increase your strength and flexibility, and even help with weight management. Plus, it's low-impact, so it's easier on your joints compared to other high-impact sports. And, did you know that swimming can help prevent injuries? It's like a natural injury prevention program! 🤯

Now, I know some people might think swimming is boring, but let me tell you, it's not! 😅 I mean, have you ever tried swimming laps in a pool? It's like a whole different world! You can swim with friends, play games like ""Marco Polo,"" or even just splash around and have fun. And, if you're lucky, you might even see some cool sea creatures like fisfishes dolphins! 🐟🐬

Personally, I love swimming because it's a great way to relax and unwind. When I'm in the water, all my worries just melt away, and I feel so free! Plus, it's a great way to get some exercise without even realizing it. I mean, have you ever tried swimming a mile? It's exhausting, but in a good way! 😅

Swimming has also had a big impact on my life. Growing up, my family didn't have a pool, so I never thought I'd be able to learn how to swim. But, my parents signed me up for swim lessons, and it was one of the best decisions they ever made! 🌟 Not only did I learn how to swim, but I also made some amazing friends and developed a newfound appreciation for the water.

"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you today to discuss a matter of great importance to me and my fellow students. I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. Furthermore, I understand that there are rules and regulations in place to ensure that students are maintaining their academic performance, but I believe that there is more to life than just academics.

As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of trying hard and making good decisions. It is not enough to just get good grades, but it is also important to be involved in extracurricular activities. Participating in sports and activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. It can also help students build self-esteem and confidence.

I understand that some students may struggle to balance academics with sports and activities, but I believe that it is important for them to try. It is not enough to just give up and focus solely on academics. Students should be encouraged to find a balance and make good decisions about how they spend their time.

I also believe that allowing students to participate in sports and activities can help them achieve their goals. Whether it is getting into college or pursuing a career, participation in extracurricular activities can help students stand out and demonstrate their dedication and commitment.

In conclusion, I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. It is important for students to try hard and make good decisions, and participation in extracurricular activities can help them develop important skills and achieve their goals. I urge you to consider this matter and make a decision that will benefit all students.

Sincerely,

"In my perspective, I believe that when viewing someone's facial, or human emotions it should be visual. I do not agree with the form of technology. By viewing someone's emotions it forms a sense of character which is good with person to person with associating with one another. According to the article, it talks about how the process with technology starts at a 3-D computer of the face which is then known to have 44 muscles which then shows the movement of the face to detect the human emotions. The article continually explains that the facial expressions are what are known to detect the emotions through technology. This ll today is showing you what all a computer can actually do. According to the article they agree on using the technology from what the computer can actually do. In my perspective I think my opinion is the opposite. Your emotions should be detected by another human’s point of view, not by technology.",0
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this technology may help teachers understand how their lessons are engaging students on an emotional level. If a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a lesson, FACS could provide valuable feedback to improve instruction methods. It could also assist teachers in identifying students who are struggling emotionally but may not express it otherwise. This type of technology could help teachers provide better emotional support to students. 

However, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions with FACS also raises privacy and behavioral issues. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being surveilled and analyzed in real time. This could increase anxiety and discourage natural emotional responses during class. Students should feel free to focus internally on learning without worrying about expressions being screened. Additionally, identifying emotions through facial expressions alone may not provide full context and could result in misinterpretations. A student's expression may not accurately reflect how they internally feel about a lesson.

Overall, while FACS technology aims to give teachers useful insights, its continuous use in the classroom to monitor students risks invading privacy and altering natural classroom behaviors. Teachers could benefit from occasional voluntary emotional check-ins with students, but constant facial monitoring goes too far. More traditional methods of teacher-student communication are generally preferable to validate a student's emotional experience in school. If used sparingly and with consent, this technology may offer value, but broader application could do more harm than good.",1
"From man's very first trip out of Earth's atmosphere to the iconic moon landing, people from all across the world have always wondered what lies in the unknown solar system that surrounds them. Despite the danger and the failures that plagued these early scientists, they still strived to explore space and the planets within it. In writing ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author is able to very convincingly explain the benefits of exploring Venus, despite the dangerous challenges this endeavor may present.

The article starts off by describing Venus and providing background for the reader, allowing the writer to make a stronger and more understandable claim later on in the work. Venus, as described in the article, is often the closest planet to Earth, depending on the time, and is repeating called ""Earth's 'twin'"" because of its similarity in size and density to Earth. The author then goes one to describe the multiple missions already taken to Venus, which have all failed in the end.

While the author does state reasons why a mission to Venus could be treacherous, he or she is able to negate these downfalls by listing all the possible benefits of exploring this inhospitable planet. Venus is considered by scientists to be a dangerous planet to explore for many reasons included in the writing.

For one, its temperature far exceeds in heat any which the Earth has reached by hundreds of degrees. The atmosphere of Venus also contains a corrosive acid which would be a great obstacle to any vehicle attempting to pass through. The author then goes on to give multiple other reasons in support of danger, but is finally able to oppose these concerns by listing all the reasons why man kind should explore Venus. For one, Venus is the planet that is most near Earth and therefore will take the shortest time to journey towards. Space travel, the author includes, is very time-consuming and not to be taken on lightly. In addition, scientists believe Venus may have once been exceedingly similar to today's Earth. By giving this information, the author is able to infer that information gained by a trip to Venus could be very much crucial to ensuring the survival of the planet home to a large amount of life. The writing claims, after all of these reasons, that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"" despite the hardships explorers would face.

In further support of this claim, the author explains the multiple ways that scientists are testing in order to make a trip to Venus possible. The article shows that already, multiple ideas have been proven to work.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is able to very successfully make the claim that Venus is worth exploring through negation of the dangers of such a trip by providing multiple benefits of a visit and the ways in which scientists have already found to make the trip possible. Exploration is exceedingly valuable to maintaining and improving life on Earth and, as written by the author, ""should not be limited by dangers and doubts.""  ",0
"Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.

Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.

Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on whom to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.

Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."" Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.",0
"Nowadays, it is widely accepted that having a graduate degree is a prerequisite for career advancement in many institutions. While a degree certificate may reflect one's academic achievements, it does not necessarily reflect all the abilities essential for a successful career. I agree with this statement for the following reasons.

First, having a graduate degree does not guarantee that one has the necessary skills for a successful career. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work in a customer service position because he or she lacks the necessary customer service skills.

Second, a degree certificate does not reflect all the abilities that are essential for a successful career. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may be able to work in a customer service position if he or she has the necessary skills, such as communication and problem-solving skills.

Third, a degree certificate may not be relevant to the job that one is applying for. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work as a doctor if he or she does not have the necessary medical knowledge.

Fourth, a degree certificate may not be current. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work as a doctor if the degree is not up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge.

In conclusion, I believe that a degree certificate does not reflect all the abilities that are essential for a successful career.

"How do you feel about students having to do an extracurricular activity? I believe that it would help students be better people. These activities will keep them out of trouble. Extra activities with new people will help improve the social skills of students. Activities such as sports will keep them healthy and active. Do you not want students to be better people for others, and themselves?

First, Students that have an extracurricular activity will stay out of trouble. When a student is doing something good for them self, and they enjoy it, they will not be getting into much trouble. If students are playing a sport they will be motivated to stay healthy and stay away from drugs. Most extracurricular activities require good behavior. Therefore, if a student gets attached to an activity they will do their best to stay out of trouble.

Secondly, Students that less social skills can meet new people. Those students can create strong, long-lasting bonds. Extracurricular activities can give students the friends they need that make them happy. Some friendships are even like family, and those types of bonds are important. We need students to have strong bonds and stronger social skills.

Finally, These activities can keep the students healthy, and active. Sports will have students always moving and keep them in shape. Some activities will teach you about nutrients and how to support your body. Activities like these will keep you healthy and make you feel better about yourself. If everyone participates in these activities than everyone will be happy, healthy, and active.

In conclusion, I believe that extracurricular activities will make students a bigger part of society. These activities will get students to behave. The students will be healthy. The activities will give the students better social skills. That is why I believe that extracurricular activities will make students be better people.",0
"Control your life or let it control you. Since technology has improved significantly since the past decades, In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" humans are able to create vehicles that drive themselves. They have their pros and cons but the cons out-shape the pros. Driverless cars are lethal, illegal, and time-consuming to manufacture.

The first reason on why driveless cars are lethal is that they are not tested fully and can injure the driver very severely if not handled right. This is evident in paragraph 9 where the author states, ""manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe."" This is a perfect example of how the driveless cars are still unstable and should be tested. Overall, companies still need to improve on some aspects on the driveless car to have it be a safe to use.

The second reason is that the utilization of driveless cars on testing is illegal. Evidence to support this claim is that the author states in paragraph 9, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This makes the invention difficult to find its shortcomings and hard to sell. More evidence is found that a lot of people can get in trouble due to this technology failing, which is found in paragraph nine again, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This can both harm them because of the injury and the company's reputation. Overall, driveless cars are suited to test because of the law.

Finally, the last reasoning on while driveless cars are suited for the market is because of time. It takes a long time to produce; this is stated by the author in paragraph 5, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" It takes the company TEN YEARS to only create one component of the device. Overall, driveless cars take a long time to produce.

Driverless cars can be conducive and negative to the consumer, but the drawbacks out match the pros with It's dangerous to control, legalization, and time-consuming process to manufacture. The technology is not ready yet for this device to hit shelves in markets and is best to wait when there is more money involved for this project.",0
"Phones & Driving

Should people be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle? Different generations would agree and disagree. Older generation would say ""No, drivers should not be able to use a phone while driving."" While newer generation would say ""Yes, drivers should be able to use a phone while driving."" I believe that drivers should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle.

Statistics state that 26% of all crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use. 10% of those crashes are teen drivers of the age 15 to 19. Teens are more likely to text and drive because their world is revolved around social media. Because teenagers are young and naïve we believe that we are more capable of multitasking but, history has shown otherwise.

Some people think they are invincible and can't be killed. So, they think can text and drive and not get hurt or face the consequences. People as they get older think they can get away with more stuff like texting and driving, but life hits them with a wake-up call.

In conclusion, do you think drivers should be able to use their cell phone while driving? People need to keep their eyes on the road and on nothing else. They need to stay focused to their surroundings. Texting and driving kills, so be careful on the roads.",0
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that we should keep the current Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States, rather than change to a popular vote system. There are several important reasons why maintaining the Electoral College is preferable.

First, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. Under a popular vote, candidates would likely focus all their efforts on population centers along the coasts and largely ignore the rest of the country. This could worsen regional divisions. The Electoral College system requires candidates to appeal to a wider range of constituencies across many states. 

However, some argue that the popular vote more directly reflects the will of the people. While it is true that the candidate who wins the national popular vote may sometimes lose the Electoral College, this system has still maintained stability for our country over many elections. It also encourages two viable national political parties and prevents third party candidates from winning with just a small percentage of votes nationwide. Changing to a strictly popular system could undermine this stability.

Additionally, smaller states argue that they would have less influence under a popular vote system. The current framework gives even the least populous states a minimum of three electoral votes, ensuring that candidates must consider their interests too. A national popular vote might diminish the role of smaller, less populated states. 

In conclusion, while the Electoral College system is imperfect, it has served the country reasonably well overall and maintains several advantages over a simple national popular vote. For these reasons, I believe we should retain the current Electoral College framework for now. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my argument. Thank you for your consideration.

"Part of our current education system provides free childcare to parents in addition to helping longer students developed socially. This is why brick and order schools will always be a necessity for elementary schoolers, but students outside that age range should have the opportunity to demonstrate their responsibility in order to receive the privilege of being taught at home rather than at school because of social distractions, and the general time sink that is school.

All you ever hear about public schools today is bullying, exclusion, and drama that is pointless and distracts students from their academics, the solution is right in front of us, online school. Online school would be superior to traditional brick and Porter school because students would have minimum opportunities to interact with one and other during class which would make classroom control easier for the teacher. In addition to students having minimum opportunities to speak in class, everything that was said during the class could be monitored by the teacher or by an automated program designed to detect any buzzwords, unkind or curse words. The automation could also keep count of the number of times students cursed or said rude things to each other and report these infractions to the teacher. While this process might sound invasive, it isn't anything that teachers don't try to facilitate with physically, now they can do it technologically.

While the in class conversations can defiantly be monitored, there is also out of class social media and texting that could be distracting during online class time, and with no physical adult in the room telling students to put away the phone how could we be sure that we aren't just trading one evil for another? While there are numerous distractions at home that could cause students grades to dip, the solution to this potential problem is that online school would need to be a privilege and not a right. Class time would need to be monitored.

Another benefit of monitored online school is that with fewer distractions the class could move faster which would allow extra time for students to pursue recreational activities, and academic interests-this system would allow students to separate their work time from their play time in a way that is just not possible today. This system of having extra time to dedicate to passions would also be beneficial in incentivizing students to pay attention during class. This system also promotes better friendships by giving students time to pursue interests outside of school-- providing an outlet to meet like-minded people.

While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that many students view school as a whole. Instead of being forced to sit in a building all day with other kids, we could be at home leaning on our own time with pre-recorded videos. With online schooling students get the opportunity to control their own education, and they are also incentivized to preform well, not because they are competing for spots at some prestigious collage, but because they want their own free time.  ",0
"Are electoral college better than other colleges. Yes i believe that an electoral college is better than other collages because they help pick the Braden and the vice president based on votes, the Electoral collage is consists on 538 votes which majority of 270 electors is required to elect the president.

An electoral college is a collage that helps pick candidates that are running for president in are state. The candidates are chosen by the political party. The election is held every 4 years on teethe first Tuesday of November. My second reason electoral collages help are state out are they help pick they right states to vote.

An electoral collage tells there president where to go and give there speeches. Presidebts seems are very important, the speeches give them vote two keep them president in charge. Some on the big voting states are Texas, california, and Florida, so in conclusion you should go two an electoral collage because they help are states out by pick the right president and keeping him.",0
"I feel like it should and here's why. First of all what happen is someone is depressed and don't want to tell anyone about it, so they kill their self because they're depressed the facial Action Coding System could have help that poor boy or girl because someone would ask her what's wrong and talk about it with him or her and know they feel that someone there for them and how much they're needed and wanted, so they don't kill there self matter as fact there are happy right now because someone is there for them, and they feel wanted, and they can love life again. My evidence why I wrote that statement is the passage it said ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" I think everyone should have this because it could save a lot of people lives because so many people take their lives away so fast and young because of depression and lot are teens if high schools and jr high haves these I feel like it would change the world for the better. Some people don't like it maybe it's because they're the stress ones that need help and think that no one cares and is too scared to show they're depressed, and they rather keep to them self. My opinion is that every school and family doctor should have this to save lives and more.",0
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for they can tell you what they did wrong, see their point of view, and learn what to do.

To begin with, they can tell you what they did wrong, so you will not do the same thing. If the person wants to do something good they would ask people for advice, so they will not do it wrong. They would tell them what they did wrong, so that he or she will do it right. For example, one day Generic_Name went to his friends what not to do at his wedding his friends started telling what not to do, so he did as they said, and his wedding went perfect.

Also, you can see their point of view. When someone is asking more than one person, because some people do it differently than others. Not everyone looks at something the same way others do they have different points of view. They ask multiple people, so the can have an idea of what to do and what not to do. For example, Generic_Name went to ask his friends for advice but all of them had different story's, but they had something's in common so that gave him an idea of what to do and what not to do.

In addition, you will learn what to do. When you ask more than one person it can help you make better choice's in life. When someone is seeking for multiple opinion It's because they want to make better choices, so when they tell you what not to do and look at their point of view they are helping you make better choices, so you don't do something wrong. On the contrary, some people think seeking multiple opinions cannot help someone make better choices, because some people can give you bad advice and can get you into big trouble.

In conclusion, asking people for advice is a good thing, because it can help you make better choice in life. Seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for people can tell you what they did wrong, see their point of view, and know what to do.",0
